RE: Why is underdosage of anesthesia and pain management so common?,"I'm not sure. I haven't witnessed any as a nurse. Before I became a nurse, I was patient. And then, as a nurse, I had an adenomyosis. My doctor was not aware that I was a nurse.

My experience with a female doctor was a nightmare—months and months of being tormented with pain around my menstrual cycle. I wasn’t sure why she was this way. She was my OBGYN who didn’t want to prescribe me contraception but would instead order narcotic medication I didn’t like. I explained to her I could not have this medication based on my experience with its side effects.  I don’t like being drowsy and would get stomach pain. I’m not too fond of the feeling of it. Anyway, she sent me for a vaginal ultrasound to find the source of my pelvic pain. It was “normal.”  She stopped here. I asked for the pill. She declined to renew it after 12-month of supply. I felt a lot better with this, so I stuck with it.

I found a male OBGYN. He diagnosed me with adenomyosis. It was a tiny part of my uterus that got affected. It hurt like hell. The doctor told me that if contraception didn’t work, surgery would be the last choice if I wanted to get rid of the pain. My life has been great since I started taking pills regularly.

I think privilege is an issue as well, and that's something that isn't necessarily discussed and it's something we can be completely unaware of despite good intentions. We can say ""I'm not biased!"" while being ignorant of privilege. In my own case, when I was pregnant in grad school, the linguistics and anthropology departments I was in worked closely with some of the med school professors (20+ years ago they were trying to design ""virtual patients"" for the med school, and there were MD/PhD programs in med anth and public health, as well). So I was introduced to my maternal-fetal medicine specialist by first name and treated collegially in a way that I had no idea wasn't normal--I had nothing to compare it to. Over a decade later, when I returned to grad school to focus more on bio anth/evolutionary medicine and related my story, which included teasing banter with the geneticist and sh!t like that, during a discussion of birth trauma, the professor basically jumped down my throat, and I was humbled--which was fine with me! I love learning new things, and I have no problem being wrong. But she basically used my experience as a jumping off point to talk about socioeconomic disparities to obstetric care, and lit my fuse as a social justice warrior. Some things we just don't see until someone points them out to us--and all the bias training in the world won't help us see our own privilege until we are open to seeing it.

And I think that comes back to what you're saying about ableism. People who can pull 48 hour shifts \[or can they? really?\] may not realize that that is privilege, not the norm, not something to measure others by.",1727302567.0

It has many, many hospital campuses throughout the state, none of which are actually affected by the storm, just the community around this specific one. They are not hurting for money. They asked for volunteers to go 3 hours away to help work nights at this hospital. Lodging at the hospital included...meaning a shared conference room or something. (Obviously the hotels are full, that isn't the issue.) But to not offer crisis pay or incentive pay or anything beyond base pay?!?

Maybe I'm just really selfish with my sleep (I have a hard time sleeping anywhere other than my bed, am effected my any noise or light, can't sleep with snoring, and will wake up easily and not get back to sleep.

All while paying us shit, never giving us raises to reflect what we do more and more or matching cost of living, never giving us incentive pay, and guilting us into picking up extra shifts or extra roles to make up the slack!

"RE: NPs sue NY for not being paid the same as physicians, stating it is due to ""gender discrimination"". Thoughts?","I’m an NP and live in Canada where I'm tied to a physician for consultative purposes ONLY if I need help with a diagnosis or treatment plan, which the requirement will be changing very soon because we have enough NPs to take over that role for new graduates. Also, we have the ability to curbside consult specialists just as a GP would. I practice completely independently to the scope of a GP. The GP has no say over my practice and is not responsible for my practice in any manner. But I would never expect to be paid the same amount. Like 75%? I'd be happy with. 

I'm with the physicians on this one. I didn't have to sacrifice my 20s and early 30s for my career. I started off with a good paying job as an RN after graduation. And now as an NP my patient benchmarks and roster are like half what a physician has to see. But that being said, I think the education argument becomes less once an NP has been practising for several years - considering we don't just graduate and stop learning (if you're a good NP). And the education in Canada is pretty rigorous and standardized and there is more regulation coming down the pipeline that will improve it more. 

That being said, I’m relating this to a family physician, not a different specialty. I’d never agree with NP basic education being similar to another specialist without having additional didactic and residency experience equivalent to that specialist’s post grad requirements.   

Plus, aren’t these NPs required to have supervision by an MD? They are not independent then. You can’t expect to be paid independent wages when someone else’s license is at stake.

Kaiser got a nice cushy contract with the state to supply Medicaid coverage, but patients already in the Kaiser system already struggle to get in with their PCPs and if they need a specialist it's an added struggle. When I did locums last year I paid for kaiser. I was not able to get into a primary and kaiser refused to pay for my adhd medication because I didn't have a kaiser psychiatrist, which likely would have taken over a year to establish.

18. The field of nursing has been, and remains, predominantly female.

19. In 2013, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that 90% of registered nurses
were women. See United States Department of Labor, Women’s Bureau, 30 Leading Occupations of Employed Women, 2013 Annual Averages, https://www.dol.gov/wb/stats/ leadoccupations.htm.

20. Nursing involves the performance of duties that require heavy physical exertion, as well as a tremendous amount of physical effort, on a daily basis.

21. Nurses’ daily physical responsibilities include lifting, moving, turning, transferring, supporting and restraining patients, many of whom are heavy, sometimes mentally ill or intoxicated, and even combative. The majority of a nurse’s workday involves walking or standing. Moreover, nurses are vulnerable to workplace violence, in particular, physical assault from patients or patient family members.

22. The physical nature of performing nursing duties substantially increases the risk of back injuries. Nurses suffer a disproportionate number of musculoskeletal disorders during their careers, stemming from the cumulative effect of repeated manual handling of patients.

23. More than half of nurses complain of chronic back pain and 38% of nurses sustain
significant back injuries that require leave from work.

RE: How do you reconcile 10/10 symptoms with patient behaviour?,">Legit question, why?

Because it's disingenuous and irresponsible to pretend that lexapro and dilaudid have identical risk profiles, whether for typical use or severity of withdrawal symptoms.

>SSRI’s cause withdrawal too but you are ok with that?

Yes? Why wouldn't I be? SSRI withdrawal is far easier to prevent/taper than opioid withdrawal. And the morbidity from SSRI withdrawal is far less severe than with opioid withdrawal.

>now it’s pounded into everyone’s head that it’s going to make everyone an addict.

Agreed. MDs are too scared of opioids.

>But again not everyone that is on an opioid medication is misusing it

Agree, and I never said they were.

>even if there is chemical dependence that is just the nature of some medications.

And it is the nature of some medications that the *degree* of chemical dependence is far higher than it is with other meds.

I think you've misread me as an opioid gatekeeper. When really my point was, you can't throw all dependencies into the same category and dismiss them or accept them on the same terms. Some patients are dependent on opioids in a negative way, others are dependent in a positive way (or at least in a neutral way). Replace ""opioids"" with ""SSRIs"" and that statement is still true. *However,* all the data we have (and our best understanding of neurochemical pathways), tells us that opioid dependence is much more *relatively* dangerous than SSRI dependence.

Like i said, the more philosophical question of whether America is focused on the wrong dependencies, is entirely valid and worth discussing. But it's a different question from whether certain dependencies are more medically dangerous than others.",1727388004.0

GI complaints? That’s the anxiety. Vision issues? Migraines…from anxiety. Involuntary movement? Run a quick EEG…but assume FND.

It can even cloud interpretation of “objective” test results, e.g. B12 deficient? Probably excessive alcohol consumption…because anxiety. They’re on an SSRI, after all.

How many times has someone told you a story that ""the doctor told us he would NEVER WALK AGAIN""? This is not how medical professionals deliver difficult news but I have heard this story at least two dozen times from different people. 

When I was working on COVID vaccination from the social services side, we had a weird tension in how physicians communicate and how patients receive them. The nurses and doctors would say-- reasonably-- ""this will significantly reduce the risk of you catching COVID, and if you do catch COVID, you're much less likely to be seriously unwell. Tomorrow, you might have a sore arm or maybe a low fever."" And the clients would hear this and come see me five minutes later and say **SHOULD I DO IT? THEY TOLD ME IT WOULD MAKE ME HAVE A SERIOUS FEVER AND ARM PROBLEMS.** I had to tell people: yes, you should do it. You should get the vaccine today.

A subset of pain-specific patients\* are hoping, I think, for one of two things:

*\*not all, obviously-- usually the internety ones*

* ""Oh, you're presenting with XYZQ? I will run you through the most expensive scanner known to man. This scanner will generate a test with a 100% definitive, undeniable, 100% perfectly accurate result. It will be indisputable. I will then give you X pill which will 100% cure this perfectly.""

RE: Need some reassurance after my first day ,"Look, I get it.  Yes, I was there once.  Since then I have trained, proctored and mentored many PA’s through the years.  Every one of us were overwhelmed initially.  The fact is, though, that we have to hit the ground running from day one. There really is no break in period.  

In general, PA’s are coming out of school much younger and less experienced in healthcare and also in the workplace as a whole.  I was 36, had owned a business and spent many years in the workforce by the time I became a PA.  I was one of the younger students in my class who were manly RN’s,  paramedics and other experienced healthcare professionals.

No employer will ask you to know the job completely on day one but they will expect a certain foundation of confidence and knowledge.  You will be expected to learn the job asap.  If someone is training you, they are taking time out of their day that they don’t have.  Respect that.

It may upset some by hearing  my take but I’m just stating facts as I know them. You’ve entered a profession where MD’s stake their license on you, fellow PA’s rely on you and patients look to you to care for them. 

MD’s get years of training to prepare for the day they assume the responsibility of being an expert in their discipline.  They have the highest expectations for competence the day they start their first job.  That’s stress, man.  We are trained as generalist who become certified and then specialize on the job with no detailed training.  I’ve seen many PA’s fail not because they didn’t have good base knowledge but because they weren’t prepared mentally.

I’ve worked ortho, Derm, ER, ENT and cardiology before settling in general surgery. To me, that’s the beauty of being a PA.  We can work anywhere.  As you gain experience, each change becomes less stressful making any change a bit less traumatic.  Knowledge will come over time.  You got to get your mentality in line now. 

Certainly the workplace has changed since I began.  Those old physicians and surgeons I worked for were a crusty bunch and hard to get along with. Those that even knew what a PA was didn’t really trust or respect PA’s.  We earned any respect they had for us over time by showing competence because if we were not competent we were gone. Period.

You’ve entered the PA profession at a good time. Hard working competent PA’s paved your way.   PA’s now have more opportunity than we ever had back then. Like I said in my first response, I don’t mean to be disrespectful.  

I know this turned into a lecture.  Sorry for that but obviously you struck a nerve. This is just my experience over 30 years.  Take from it what you want.

RE: How do you reconcile 10/10 symptoms with patient behaviour?,"In the inpatient setting, we can look at objective measures to compare pain levels before and after being medicated: NIBP, respiratory rate, HR, if they’re sleeping, do they look drowsy, etc. If you wake a pt up and they immediately report 10/10 and then fall back asleep, then your spidey sense should tingle a little bit. 

In both settings, there’s obviously a highly subjective nature to the question. Having people describe their pain (rather than rating 1-10), and asking then how it impacts their functional status is important. A chronic 8/10 may go to work everyday and stay active. An acute 8/10 process may not be able to get out of bed. Pain should be treated, but that doesn’t just mean narcotics. Multi-modal analgesia is crucial. Scheduled Tylenol, NSAIDs, TENS, gabapentin, lidocaine patches, voltaren, PT/OT referrals even alternative therapies like acupuncture, Thai chi, hypnotism (that’s right I said it!). Inpatient therapies can add epidurals, nerve blocks and ketamine infusions if it’s acute trauma pain, ischemic pain, post surgical pain.

I know there’s a lot of resistance from patients to doing anything other than narcotics (“x,y,z thing just doesn’t work on me”), especially when it comes to movement, PT/OT, but as a clinician, we absolutely need patient buy-in to do the hard  and/or annoying things like scheduling OTCs and engaging PT.

","> Are there legions of doctors that exist somewhere who just tell all patients that they’re faking, or whatever else the complaints online call out???

Yes. And I don’t think it’s malicious. I think it’s burnout. You begin to internally triage more and more. You need to expend your energy on the person who is legitimately quite ill or complex, is compliant with meds, and is not an AH to you. I’ve heard a lot of “I’ve never seen someone die from pain. 😂” from doctors when patients are probably legitimately suffering (ruptured cyst, for example, or a pediatric burn patient)

> …do their personalities completely flip when I’m not interacting with them, and they become huge assholes to every patient???

Some of them. These I would categorize as the more sociopathic / malicious ones. Often men towards women. These are probably your same colleagues who beat their wives.

Oh, yeah, sorry. I’m 100% sure those exist too in some quantity. And this is also not intended to call these individuals evil. Those situations evolve over time, and are caused by numerous small factors which become larger issues over time.

> Seriously, though, where do all these comments come from?

Ok. So, a few quick anecdotes from my professional experience:

A full doctor (MD), who looks very alarmed and in a patient care handoff tells me, “She’s obviously having a heart attack. So I gave her some nitro paste and she’s on oxygen, and I’ve given her some aspirin, and we’re transferring her out.” I was with the 911 system at the time, not a transfer service. But that was the least egregious bit of this, as the EKG was clear and the patient had Bell’s Palsy. I said, “O.K., thank you.”, cause… TF do you even say to that? You’re not just in the wrong ballpark, you’re off playing volleyball.

An MD gave a 100 lb 20-something RN with chronic pancreatitis 4 of Dilaudid, then called 911 when she stopped breathing, then as I’m working the respiratory arrest, they come in *to give her more morphine for the transport so she’s comfortable*. “Ummm… I have narcotics I can give her if she complains of pain, it’s ok, thanks.”

An MD was attempting to treat pneumonia with albuterol and mag and couldn’t understand why he wasn’t seeing improvement. No antibiotics given, despite availability. Patients pressure was 80/40 and heart rate was in the 150s when I picked them up. I didn’t talk to him.

Two things to learn from this: 1) if I don’t ask you questions, I probably don’t agree with your treatment. 2) these are the things I remember the best not because this is indicative of how doctors are, but inherently because they are outliers. Patients can see 100 doctors 100 times, but it’s the 1 doctor that 1 time who is rude or dismissive that they will remember

I think patients for whom this is possibly legitimately true are also more likely to be online. We’ve all had them. The patient who complains of chest pain but really they’re just seeking or lonely and then one day they DO have a (cocaine induced) MI and they go, “SEE?! I told you I was having heart problems!!!!”

I think the confluence of these last two factors can really make some online spaces feel demoralizing.",1727281786.0

Just need to listen to your coworkers holding PRN or not telling the MD current pain meds are inadequate, when someone labeled a junky is there. In undeniable orthopedic pain, just so you can’t claim they are just drug seeking.

The job needs to get done. The job is to debrief that cyst. More local anesthetic isn’t essential to getting the job done, and the patient being in pain can thus be ignored.

Looking For Career Advice,"First, I want to give a shout out to all you hard working nurses out there, much respect for your hard work.

I am located in Canada.

My life took an unexpected nose dive in the last few years and I have had to make a lot of unexpected and difficult life changes. I find myself in a bit of a career conundrum and would appreciate opinions from those in the field of nursing.

I have worked in healthcare for around 15 years now. I started off as a Dietitian but the job market wasn't great so I went back and got my Sonographer designation. I have been scanning for almost a decade now. I also taught for a couple years. During this time I got my Masters in clinical education and teaching. In my class, I was the only non-nurse. 

As I was completing all the coursework I found the various jobs, experiences, and work that my classmates were doing fascinating. I found my passion was definitely in teaching and research, and how to improve overall healthcare systems and organizations.

Along with the major life changes I also ended up having to deal with a handful of serious health issues that have opened my eyes to the fact that, long term, I am going to be looking at having to go into a job that is not fully patient facing/has some sort of office/brainwork component and not all physical.

And this is when I found that my career choice was a complete dud. Despite my years of patient care, leadership, starting up a rural clinic, teaching etc....everything I have looked at in healthcare that would fit the long term goal requires you to have an RN.

I even saw a career advisor and looked at what I would need to branch off into some sort of corporate work...and once again hit a dead end. Apparently no one sees the skillset of a sonographer as being translatable to anything but being a sonographer.

There is a program close to me where I would qualify to enter the accelerated nursing program and could get the RN designation in about two years.

I would appreciate the thoughts of the group? And please be honest (I know healthcare can be the voyage of the damned at times)

I am late 30's and a lot of things have not gone as planned. So I am trying to do as much research as I can before I make any decisions. And this is the most practical approach so far (I also found out with the Master's I have I could qualify for a post grad NP route as well).

So, am I out to lunch? Or is this a decent plan for the long term?

That's in contrast to a chiropractor who would likely do an x ray, interpret it with minimal training and no radiologist, and treat it with manipulation.

Like... If you walked into a chiropractor with a spinal epidural abscess, how many of them would say ""hmm... History of IVDU and a fever? Go to the ED"" Vs ""hmmm. Take some Tylenol and let's get cracking.""

RE: Question for ED Nurses from an ED Doctor,"*My brother in Christ...*

I’ve been a night shift CT tech in trauma centers for over a decade and this is SUCH a problem. There’s usually 1-2 of us (even at massive academic facilities with 1,500+ beds and 100+ ER rooms), sometimes 1 doing both CT and XR, transporting and sliding every ER patient to and from the department 2-3x each. And that’s not counting having to drop everything for a stroke or trauma, and fit in those timed neuro heads, allergy preps, and any other surprises from the floor throughout the night, all while the work list continues to grow.

Please, if at all possible, put all imaging orders in at once. Not only is it hard on the patient with rib/spine/pelvic fractures to bounce back and forth to the table(s) unnecessarily (if you’re ordering a pan scan and order everything but a c-spine, and we ask if you want that done while we have them on the scanner, it’s because we know it’s going to be placed either by you or someone else 20 minutes later), but we’re so abysmally understaffed at damn near every facility (and i’ve worked at hella different health systems at this point), and spending the majority of our time physically moving humans, that it keeps us from getting any other patient in the hospital done.

It blows my mind that with how stat every CT scan is, how pivotal they are to getting damn near every single patient moved through the ER and beyond, the amount of money they bring in, and how we get called literally every 3-5 minutes asking, “When are you getting _____?” “How many are in front of _____?” “This one has been waiting _____.” “Why hasn’t _____ been read yet?” (Best I can do is give you the number for the reading room, completely out of our hands, sorry.) “What’s going on with all of these scans that need done?” but no one in admin has come to the conclusion that we might need some extra fucking help.

"RE: So are there just hoards of doctors just telling every patient their symptoms are all in their heads, or they're faking, or having period pains? ","A big part is the perception of the patient vs perception of the provider. 

As an ER doc I can't tell you the number of times I'll sit down and explain findings of a w/u only to have the nurse grab me 5 minutes later because ""the patient wants to know what is going on."" Or people come in with an expectation that we are going to find a clear diagnosis and/r completely resolve there symptoms and freak out when we don't find anything emergent and discharge them with out patient follow-up.

Furthermore, I think there is a priming effect but on the patient end.

RE: Florida Department of Health emergently suspends license of physician who removed liver instead of spleen.,"After having read multiple articles regarding this tragic case and the Order of emergency suspension (as a non surgical physician, and not an expert ) I strongly suspect he was (1) impaired (2) not competent and (3) lacking basic integrity (4) under some kind of financial pressure. 

My lay suspicion for what actually happened, is based on the the absolute impossibility of anyone systematically dissecting a liver while believing it is a spleen, and  absolute impossibility of even a drunk medical student later mistaking an intact liver on a slab for a spleen (came back at least 3 different time and still called it a spleen).

He probably started the dubious laparoscopy with intent to remove the spleen, ran up against this distended colon, and accidentally nicked something vascular, causing blood in his field. Forced to switch to open laparotomy, he shortly ended up cutting the IVC, causing massive bleeding, cardiac arrest, and panic. In his panic, he never even asked for a clamp or suction, according to OR staff, just kept clicking away with his stapler, just tearing things up and making things worse, which makes me wonder about basic competence. 

With patient in cardiac arrest, he proceeds to explore right side of peritoneal cavity instead of left, identify & cut falciform, round, hepatorenal, IvC, ligaments, ligamentum venosum, portal vein, hepatic artery hepatic veins, and common bile duct, pull out this gargantuan 5 pound organ, then declare “I got the spleen! Look, it’s a spleen guys!” Then comes back multiple times and looks at a 5 pound liver that’s shaped exactly like a liver in the textbooks and any medical student would call a liver, and continues to call it a spleen. 

He was desperately trying to come up with a cover narrative that would result in the least punitive consequences for himself (probably started thinking about this when he first went to open laparotomy), but was coming up blank, so he just stuck to his original story, sticking with consistency, like liars often do, even if it is insultingly demonstrably untrue. 

I also I wonder if he was under deep financial pressure of some kind too, because otherwise why would he spend 3 days trying to convince his patient to get a dubious splenectomy, even pressuring him by misrepresenting a minimal drop in Hgb to imply urgency when the guy wanted to get back to a hospital near home? And he scheduled it at a hospital where they don’t even do splenectomies, at 4:00 end of day with minimal staffing, and then showed up an hour late (though obviously, being an hour late is nothing suspicious on its own).

This reminds me of the [karolinska institute](https://upworthyscience.com/a-star-surgeon-left-a-trail-of-dead-patients-and-his-whistleblowers-were-punished/) case where Paolo Macchiarini was mutilating patients with plastic tracheas that he claimed to be stem cell enhanced… even doing operations on people who didn’t need them.

A nurse saved my life ,"I just feel very overwhelmed with gratification so I wanted to post this mostly as a thank you to all nurses. As a background, I’m a 31 y/o female and work in the service industry. I’m used to being exposed to illness, especially during the COVID-19 epidemic. I’m a past smoker (have quit for 3 years at this point), and the whole pandemic made me worried because I felt as a smoker I was more compromised than others. 

I first started feeling sick about a month ago, but it was very mild, cold like symptoms. No problem, I’m a single woman and can take care of myself. Then it became different, I couldn’t swallow, I couldn’t talk, I was very genuinely bed ridden with everything feeling painful.. even moving to go to the restroom felt like a chore. I was very worried I had Covid. So I was specifically looking up how to remedy myself.

I’m a waitress, I don’t have company given health insurance and if I felt like it wasn’t horrible; I could handle it myself. This is that kind of situation. I did what I normally do and tried to take care of myself.

Weeks went by and after very much urgency and care from some friends, I went to the hospital. It was late, like 11 pm. I went to the emergency care room because I really didn’t know where else to go. I couldn’t talk at this point, I typed what I needed to say on my phone. I told them my symptoms and they very clearly saw I wasn’t well. 

To their credit, the doctors on at that time were wanting to run tests on me, like an MRI, and do what they could. Very unfortunately, I started to cry because I knew this would clearly become a very expensive bill and I could not afford it. I refused these services. 

While they contemplate what to do, a very sweet nurse named Melissa was trying to reassure me. I felt like a bad person, like I was prohibiting these people from doing their jobs. It’s morbid but I felt like I didn’t care if I wasn’t able to be diagnosed. She kept telling me “we have so many tools, and we will figure this out.”

She’s getting me set up to stay the night and she notices a scratch on my arm. A very small scratch. She asked what it was from and I explained my cat and I play a little rough sometimes (my cat loves belly rubs but sometimes she decides we’re done very abruptly). She asks more simple questions, like if she’s and outside cat and whatnot (she’s not). 

She leaves and I assume talks to a doctor. The doctor comes in and does a quick swab and leaves. I had literal “cat scratch fever” from my cat’s bad timing to accidentally scratch me after using her litter box before cleaning herself. 

Very simple antibiotics and a stern look to my cat later and we’re all good. Thank you to all nurses that ask these kind of questions. She could’ve very well ignored such a minuscule scratch but she didn’t. She found out that I had a pet and that my symptoms matched up with a simple infection.

Given that I had waited maybe too long and had a fever for about two days (mild) at this point, it could’ve been worse if I had waited. You all are Saints and please never think that what you do isn’t appreciated. 

Thank you Melissa in a southwest Florida hospital. You know who you are if you read this, but I don’t want to accidentally cause problems if I’m too specific.

I’m finding that any time I’m suspicious of a HAPI, I am asked to go through allllll of the charted repositioning and try to find a gap. It’s kind of dumb because of course no one is going to truthfully chart that they didn’t reposition their patient. 

My co-workers get really defensive and almost insulting declaring “not everything on a bony prominence is a PI!!!” or “if there’s no documented pressure factor, how could it be a PI?!?!”. Then they go through some mental & word gymnastics to call the wound anything but a PI (evolved MASD, wound of unknown etiology) when it’s so very obvious that it’s a HAPI. All because of pressure (no pun intended) from leadership to have zero HAPIs.

RE: Question for ED Nurses from an ED Doctor,"Urine samples are so awful for patient throughput. I make a point to not order them just because they are on the order set. Been on the nurse side of that nonsense too many times before being an NP.

When I want urine on an ambulatory patient I give them a urine cup and send them to the bathroom when I do my initial exam. Tell them to go to the bathroom, bring the sample back into this room. The nurse can send it to the lab when they come in to do all the orders I am putting in for the patient. Get it before they are put on a monitor and IV drip, etc.

Otherwise, it's HOURS to get it through no fault of the nurse. This way we don't have to unhook EVERYTHING after the patient finally ""has to pee"" in about two to three hours (and usually RIGHT NOW after a liter of IV fluids.)

Conversely I’ve seen people with bullet wounds, open fractures, etc say they have a 4/10. It’s worthless. 

When they get re evaluated, you just ask if what you did before was enough, if not then escalate your regimen, repeat until symptom relief. It’s also important to set expectations early. I tell all my patients the goal is not the absence of pain, just to get it to a tolerable level while the underlying issue heals. People tend to be fairly understanding when you frame it for them. 

Also truthfully I’m just not here to be the gatekeeper of pain meds. I’m a judicious prescriber, but single doses/short courses don’t significantly lead to addiction issues.

Patients always super grateful. Like by the time you give the 4/10 pain med and it kicks in, they say it's up to a 7 or 8 by the time it takes it to work, so you're better off giving the 7/10 pain med anyway.

I have had to stand outside of a patients room waiting and watching as a mom and dad were hugging their 3 year old and sobbing because we were putting in one more ecmo cannula (when he already had 3- his cardiac anatomy and flows were weird because of a glenn operation with extra things) as a last ditch effort even though prior to this we all talked as a surgery team in private and knew the patient wouldn’t make it. I put that kid of ecmo 2 days before this and then he died 3 days later on my shift. Seeing those parents cry over their baby that they knew was dying while I was pregnant with my second and had a 1 year old at home was so incredibly difficult.

All of that’s to say that I guarantee you that if anyone had to be those parents watching their little human that they created be taken away and couldn’t control it they would be a little bit more respectful to those who took care of their kiddo. Because they understand that we truly try our best to ensure that proper care is being met for everyone. And sometimes we might not be able to focus on their kiddo at that time because they are stable. Because they are safe. And sometimes that results in a diaper rash or a crying baby that’s hungry. And while I understand those parents can be upset- they need to take a step back and be grateful that they do not have to be the parents that are woken up and rushed out of their kids room at 3am because we are cracking their chest (this is a true story)",1727675996.0

RE: Case Management Job Search,"Revamp your resume! One of the top pieces of advice I got was that my resume was too ""nursey"" and made it look like I was seeking another clinical position, when in fact I wanted to go into something nonclinical. Having a HR person review my resume was the best thing I could have done.

Look at a job description for the type of position you would like. Identify key words of what they are looking for. Figure out how to describe the skills you've gained in your clinical positions using words from the job description.

I started my resume with a Skills/Qualifications section where I added some key words from the job description, where applicable.

I slimmed down the wordiness of the work experience section, and included more keywords. Example: I was applying for a research nurse position; in the position I was leaving, I had experience collaborating with CRCs and CNRCs, with caring for clinical trial patients, and with reading clinical trial materials, so I included those skills into the job description. 

Later I found a Utilization Management position I was really interested in. Tailored the resume, got hired. With the experience you have, I am certain you can transition into Case Management.  Just gotta get that resume past the AI screening tools with keywords!

RE: Is it inappropriate to shave a comatose patient?,"I was in a trauma ICU as a patient at 17 years old from a nearly fatal MVA. I wasn’t comatose, but my consciousness was a bit touch and go for the first week. The first few rounds of nurses I had behaved as if they were scared to do anything for me besides medicate me. My hair was soaked in dried blood, my mouth was bloody from injuries, both of my legs were hooked to wound vacs and stapled and stitched from top to bottom with dried blood around them. I felt disgusting and helpless because I couldn’t do anything about it. But there was one nurse on day shift, who came in with a whole basin full of supplies to bathe me without me asking. The mouth swabs (I couldn’t open my mouth enough to brush my teeth), a razor to shave my armpits, waterless shampoo, the whole works. All that to say, she shaved my armpits for me because I couldn’t, washed my hair and even braided it because I couldn’t, and helped me with the little bit I could do. And I will never forget her, she was the first nurse that made me feel human in the most traumatic time of my life. From a patient and nurse standpoint, I don’t think it’s inappropriate to do grooming and hygiene for those that can’t, but like others have said asking next of kin is best course of action.

ETA- Thank you so much for all the upvotes, this is still a hard story to tell at times.

Unfortunately, this crates a situation worse than actual lack of a warning - people become complicit and just click through without reading.

Yes they can be. However the incidence rate and severity is far lower than withdrawing from opioids. And tapering SSRI/SNRIs is far easier than tapering opioids for the vast majority of patients.

The global risk of SSRI/SNRI withdrawal is lower than opioid withdrawal. That doesn't mean the SSRI/SNRI withdrawal risk is *zero.* But it does mean that when talking about dependency, the two groups should not be considered medically equal (which is the point i was responding to).

> Signed a patient who was treated like a drug seeker for needing a venlafaxine script and met with incredulity that there would be any physical withdrawal symptoms.

Sorry to hear that. Personally I don't understand why anyone stops psychiatric or mood-altering meds without some kind of taper. The brain is remarkably plastic and you can't take meds like ssri/snri without some form of response on the part of the brain itself. Remove the meds, and the brain has to readjust. Tapering is a zero risk intervention, so i just do it for everyone.

>As a family medicine/gp it's a bit of a worry you don't recognize this.

RE: Question for ED Nurses from an ED Doctor,"I love that you’re asking this! The first thing that comes to mind: Understand that ED nurses have more than one patient & we have to prioritize care based on acuity, especially in the nursing shortage we’re in. ED providers can be myopic & overly focused only on the patient in front of them rather than the department as a whole. You might be tempted to hustle along aspects of care to get to dispo on specific patients for your own convenience. E.g. bugging the nurse to get a urine sample on a stable patient so you can discharge them when the nurse is busy getting a work-up started on a sicker patient you aren’t the provider for, etc. I’ve had so many ED providers do this because they want to go home & don’t want to give handoff to another doc, etc. and it’s frustrating, especially if it’s just a checking the box thing & they’ve already made dispo decision. We have to juggle care for many patients and may have different priorities than you based on sick vs not sick. We will get to all the tasks, but have to allocate resources toward patients who need them most - and our time/attention are resources. If you have to expedite care, please consider your requests in the best interests of the patient & be understanding.

I make 110k in base salary with bonuses on production which amounts to about 5k per year. I get 200 hours of PTO (including CME),  and 1500 in CME expenses.  This coming year they are going to provide a 401k with 3% match.  They pay for malpractice and for my license, and certification expenses, etc.  No health insurance.  My question is what does this compare to anyone else in middle Tennessee region, we are not Nashville, so I am not looking for big city pay.  I know that TN does not pay the greatest, but I am looking for a 3% annual standard cost of living raise, and am told they can't afford to do that. I bring in at least 350k to the office in revenue.  I would appreciate any feedback or thoughts on the salary and the ask for the 3% annual.  Thanks again",1727475291.0

RE: Why is underdosage of anesthesia and pain management so common?,"I know my daughter has, until this last admission, always been under treated. She’s only 3, which I think is some of the reason. 

All surgeries have only been treated with acetaminophen and ibuprofen. She had her trach stoma dilated and new trach replaced (blood everywhere, only 2 month old trach, so pretty new stoma) in the ER with nothing and multiple adults holding her down. IV placements with ultrasound would take hours with nothing given to help calm her down (she has almost no access at all). 
She had a recent admission where they finally started treating her like a real person and it was a night and day difference. She was given morphine PRN after broviac placement, given versed for an IV placements, heavily sedated for PICC line attempt (2.5 hours in IR, couldnt get a PICC - so literally, no access left in her). 

It’s not much better from what I’ve seen on the adult side when the patient wasn’t able to advocate for themselves. I’ve had to fight with providers to pre medicate prior to intense wound care, or first trach change on an anxious patient.

1. Stick up for us, patients and management.

2. When we ask a question about an order, instead of berating us for why we're questioning you, turn it into a teaching moment. It'll help us provide better care in the long run, and help us anticipate orders in the future. 

3. Accept that patients will tell the nurse a whole story, then when the doctor comes in will add 5 other serious details to the same story. Like ' oh they're just here for toe pain! ' then the patient says ' oh I was bit by a rattlesnake an hour ago on that toe. ' (this is sarcasm, but they will be there for toe pain then turn around and say chest pain when the doctor comes in)

4. Remember we're humans too with complex lives outside the hospital. 

5. If we say, hey somethings not right, come assess the patient. We might not be able to tell you what is wrong, bit we're good on picking up on subtle patient changes because we're at the bedside more minutes than you get with the patients.

Being a new grad anywhere is going to be extremely tough especially the first year, but you should start to feel less overwhelmed and a general grasp after a year, not exactly comfortable tho (depending on specialty ) but more manageable.

RE: Question for ED Nurses from an ED Doctor,"Please explain your plan to patients when you can, we understand when things evolve but I've worked with a lot of doctors who go do their assessment and then just leave and I'm stuck scrambling when I go in the room next and the patient wants to know why they're getting a CT scan

Please learn where basic stuff in the unit is. The amount of time and hassle that's saved from you knowing where a urine cup and handing it to them because it's literally in the room is vs telling the patient you want a sample and then coming to find me to tell me to bring them a urine cup, or a piece of gauze, or other stuff that's literally right next to you but you have to come find me to get it, we both could've been saved a good ten minutes of futile interaction. 

Please feel free to tell me what your plan is. Even if it's a basic workup. I'm more than happy to know what you're thinking. It helps me and helps the patient. And definitely if you're doing something that's maybe a little more or less than might be typical for the presentation. It helps all of us to be on the same page.

If your unit has access to stuff like epic messages or similar and your nurses use them, please use them and check them. It's so much easier to shoot you a message you can answer at your convenience for nonurgent stuff than to try to hunt you down to ask or remember to the next time I see you. 

This might be niche but try to pay attention to unit limitations. My unit often has an issue with no transporters no techs and backed up CT on nights. I have a doc that regularly throws tantrums at the charge nurse and leaves all caps comments on the track board about why a patient hasn't been to CT yet and it's because we literally have no one to take them there and CT is still two code strokes deep.

Pilonidal cysts are like my worst fear I couldn’t imagine having such a callous response to that.

My cousin had gotten a nail in his foot and the nurse just started, without any warning, digging into his foot and giving no anesthesia as she started cutting into it. Eventually my aunt demanded she stop and then she got the help of a different nurse who gave him the anesthesia (he was 11 years old when this was happening)

Or like how during cervical biopsies it’s so common to give women absolutely nothing for the pain? That’s insane, if someone took a chunk out of my penis I would want them to numb it.

RE: Feeling some sort of way that the city got an “evacuate immediately” order and we all had to stay at the hospital ,"In NOLA, and I believe many other costal areas in the gulf, this is our protocol for hurricanes:
Once a year, or whenever your hospital allows, you sign up for one of 2 or 3 teams. I’ve heard of some hospitals that have an A, B, and C team. I don’t really know what a C team is, as no hospital I’ve ever worked in had one. 

You pick your team. No one forces your hand. I’ve never had even experienced or seen peer pressure or guilt from mangers during this process. I’ve never been in a situation where we didn’t have enough people volunteer for the A team.

You place your name, and any other information they need depending on your answer. When I choose to be on the A team, I had to fill out my emergency contact, blood type, weight, and height. (Weight for helicopter evac reasons, or so I’m told)

A team rides the hurricane out. They stay at the hospital when they are notified to be there by and all the way up until the B team comes to relieve them. 
You bring your own clothes and snacks but the hospital generally provides food for you, 3 meals a day. You are paid 24/7 the entire time you are there. You only work 12 hour shifts and stay in empty patient rooms/hang out off 12 hours- but are still paid. And usually it’s time and a half pay for those hours. 
If you can bring children, spouses, or pets is up to the hospital. To my knowledge, no hospital in NOLA currently allows pets- but some allow any dependents you have come stay with you as well. 

The experience of staying during a hurricane is not as scary as it seems, and is actually quite boring (barring the Katrina exception). Hospitals have big boss generators so electricity never goes out and will spend the coming days shipping out as many patients as possible before the hurricane hits. A team can be there for 2 or 3 days usually (sometimes even a day). 

B team is meant to come back as soon as the hospital notifies them to- usually when the national guard/government gives the all clear for people to re-enter the city. B team does not stay 24 hours, they are expected to go home after their 12 hour shift, but hospitals usually provide either hotels nearby or empty patient rooms for any staff who need a place to stay (due to lack of electricity or home damage).

A team, I believe, is usually supposed to have a full 24 hours off before having to report for their next shift. 

There are certain exceptions that can excuse you from both teams- this is usually pregnancy or military service, but your manager can usually give you an exception on a case by case basis.",1727674064.0

This also doesn't explain the huge discrepancy in cost between nations. Olympic costs $50 to $100 a month in Europe and $1,000 or more per month in the US...

Now it's possible that they are dumping (selling below cost) in Europe and subsidizing with American sales. But even then, American consumers are paying more than the cost plus profit to subsidize other nations.

I’m a new nurse and am being bullied & ready to leave my job.,"Hello! I just need to vent somewhere because my job is putting me in a bad head space. I am in my early 20’s & graduated nursing school last year. The issue is with a coworker. I used to get along with this person fine but since they have taken over a leadership role, I feel like I am being targeted. Everything I do is criticized, nothing I do is right, and am getting scolded like a child in front of my coworkers. They are like mid 40’s mind you. I know there is still so much I don’t know, and I have never acted like I know everything, but every time they talk to me it’s to make me feel like I’m stupid or tell me how something “should” be done (majority of this advice is unsolicited & given in a very passive aggressive manner). This person is also lazy, they never help others unless it was their one buddy they have. Their side of the department is not busy and hardly ever has patients, while my side of the department is drowning, yet they still get paid 40 hours a week to sit & play games while everyone else runs their head off. One example of this is I had a really horrible shift, and I had just gotten a patient back to recover from a surgery. They (without me even asking) come into my room and start criticizing how I am not assessing the patient and being thorough enough (I truly was) & makes a fuss at me for there being one drop of blood on the patient’s table from a blood draw (I was actively also getting ready to clean it). Well something else happened and I had to run out really quick. As I was doing this, my other patient had an accident & while I was gone my other coworkers were really kind & cleaned them up. Mind you this whole day my coworker did nothing but jack around. Anyway, when I get back this coworker absolutely rips into me, telling me I was leaving my coworkers on purpose (I wasn’t) & that it “leaves a bad taste in others mouth’s when you abandon your patient”. I shortly after went in the breakroom and cried for a few minutes. The worst thing about that night was I ended up getting a UTI from not being able to go the bathroom all day from how busy it was.

"RE: NPs sue NY for not being paid the same as physicians, stating it is due to ""gender discrimination"". Thoughts?","No, not anywhere near. This isn't to disrespect NPs, but the education/training is unfathomably lower than MD/DOs. An NP is an RN who took a 1-year online self-paced course to get their NP. The course covers very superficial pathophysio, and is composed of a ton of fluff like ""leadership"" and ""nursing theory""  courses, aka, nothing clinically relevant to treat anyone. Once they finish, they don't do a residency and fellowship like MD/DOs. They go straight into the field. It's terrifying and dangerous to patients if they practice without physician oversight.

MD/DOs take 4 years of undergrad, then the MCAT, 4 years of medical school, 3-9 years of residency, 2-3 years of fellowship. MD/DOs take USMLE Step 1 in medical school, Step 2 before graduating medical school, and Step 3 in training. Each exam is roughly 8-10hours. In addition, MD/DOs participate in extensive research throughout their training in order to further increase their expertise in their respective fields. After all this, then an MD/DO can practice.

--Student chant regularly heard during our time in OMT (osteopathic manipulative therapy) lab, especially during craniosacral training, adapted from  the original Star Trek ([S3E4](https://youtu.be/onntXB7qRts?si=KRk1Qj0XdCAIGcJO)), with our apologies to the series. 

Most DOs don't use OMT in practice. At all. A study published in 2021 put the number who don't use it at around 60%. And around 20% more don't use it for 95% to 99% of patients. Fewer than 4% use it for more than 75% of their patients. And this was an email survey, so I'll eat my hat if it's not skewed positively toward OMT since there is a small subset of DOs who are OMT fanatics and it's probable they were more likely to respond that others.  

From personal knowledge, I can tell you that what of OMT that is practiced, it is mostly performed by general/family practitioners.  And, anecdotally, I'd say 90%-plus of the time it's done more as performative art, for it's placebic value, than for anything else. It's a kind of an added value ""Why not?"" attitude rather than any strong belief that it's doing something clinically significant to the patient's actual pathology.   

That said, patients *do* like it and it does feel good in the moment. For all the fun most of us made of OMT (there were a handful of ardent acolytes of the art who took it *very* seriously), pretty much everyone enjoyed the lectures, because they were a cognitive break, and especially lab because, again, it does feel good. But almost no one took much of OMT very seriously and certainly not the weirder claims made by some of the professors who taught it. Most viewed it as being potentially an occasionally marginally useful adjunct to ""real medicine"" for a limited number of musculoskeletal problems and even less certainly as an even more marginal adjunct for a limited number of other problems (say, rib raising in patients with pneumonia, although its efficacy being greater than or even equal to standard manual respiratory therapy methods is dubious). 

This would seem to be the reason why ""MDs and DOs...seem to be doing fine together"". DOs, by and large, practice medicine just like MDs  and MDs, by and large, practice medicine just like DOs.

No expert, and I’m sure you and many others know more than I.

I’m sure it wasn’t premeditated murder. But you could argue that some of his actions were reckless disregard for life and manslaughter. Operating impaired, not calling for help… I don’t think surgically dissecting a liver while believing it’s a spleen can be “incompetence”. Because it requires a lot of applied knowledge to cut multiple liver ligaments, portal vein, hepatic arteries and veins, bile duct… you can’t not know that you’re removing a liver. Maybe he accidentally cut the hepatic artery initially (the pulsating thing he claimed was an aneurysm) and in his drunken state, decided the best way to “cover up” his mistake was to complete the hepatectomy? 

There’s no logic to it, but it sure feels like incompetence PLUS an insultingly ham handed attempt to cover up his mistakes, based on panic or drunk logic. He knew damn well it was a liver when he kept coming back to call it a spleen.",1727615422.0
new grad ER job - low salary but good benefits & training?,"Hello all,

I have been searching for jobs for a little over a month now in the Metro Detroit area of Michigan. I have been really trying to get into hospital systems (and non for profit) that will allow me to do PSLF. My main interests are cardiology, emergency med, and internal med, and possibly primary care.

I have this really great physician group that works for local hospitals that just offered me an ER job that would be close to home....**however base pay is only 95K** (for 14 shifts per month). Any shifts over 14 per month is 70$ per hour, but from reading it seems like doing more than that will lead to quicker burnout. They are known to have a really good training program and I have rotated with the group during clinical rotations and the docs and APPs were all awesome, friendly, supportive.

Some info on benefits... no PTO, no holiday pay, no PSLF, have to work every other weekend and half of the major holidays. 401K/Profit Sharing 5%. Cash pension – 2% Eligible after one year & 1000 hours of service. 3000$ CME, health insurance, malpractice, pays for licensing, and an annual bonus which is eligible after 1 year of service.

I am considering this job even with the LOW salary bc I would like ER experience to use to get into cardiology in the future, good training program, I want to start working asap!!, its a hospital setting and close to home, well known for supportive providers and training. *BUT, is the salary just too low to even consider regardless of the pros?? Should I just stay unemployed for months after graduation continuing to try to get into a hospital facility??*

RE: Does Wernicke encefalopathy arise because of alcohol withdrawal or is it just most frequently seen in these patients?,"Specifically arising during EtOH withdrawal is probably coincidence as it's more common in alcohol use disorder generally: alcohol-based diets tend to be very low in thiamine, and alcohol may disrupt absorption of thiamine.  So patients who display Wernicke encephalopathy in a state of alcohol withdrawal were probably going in that direction anyway.

I haven't thought about WE specifically in an EtOH withdrawal setting before, so I can only offer some educated speculation otherwise, but some possible ideas:

* They may not actually have the full Wernicke picture but are classified as such because they are in alcohol withdrawal delirium (i.e., encephalopathy) and clinical anchoring bias takes over (i.e., an encephalopathic alcoholic must be Wernicke encephalopathy)
* Alcohol withdrawal is a hyperactivated state which may place higher energy demands on the body and ""reveal"" the deficit of thiamine when cellular respiration is too slow to keep up with the energy demand.
* Alcohol withdrawal is more ""obvious"" and more likely to land you in a hospital, where clinicians will identify Wernicke encephalopathy incidentally.",1727358639.0

"RE: So are there just hoards of doctors just telling every patient their symptoms are all in their heads, or they're faking, or having period pains? ","Let me ask you this: Were you still taught that Black women need fewer pain killers? Or has the curriculum been revised?

The problems I see with medical training that hinder analyzing things like gender bias include hierarchy and bullying—you’re not supposed to question higher-ups but shut up and do what you’re told; sleep deprivation—it’s been shown to impair empathy and emotional intelligence; inhumane work schedules enhanced by stimulant use—impair critical thinking and attract adrenaline junkies with superiority complexes; and rote memorization rather than analysis, which includes not challenging what’s in the textbook. 

From the point of view of my field (and probably sociology and public health as well), you could diagnose medical training itself as “unhealthy” and “toxic” and “in need of medicine.” It is very difficult to challenge bias in situations where people don’t have or take the time to discuss the topic and do self-analysis. In fact, students who go in without biases sometimes come out with them—this includes female students, Native American students, etc. 

Physicians and other healthcare providers who are interested in challenging dogma, however, generally grit their teeth, hold their noses, and get through school, THEN incorporate more humane, ethical, and justice-orientated models in their own practices. I don’t have a good answer for this. In a fantasy world run by science and public health instead of by MBAs, I could envision curricular changes, union-like work protections for trainees, government scholarships to med school for rural medicine or that focused on restorative justice.

I agree with everybody else that it's a polite thing to do but it's good to assess patient history (for religious values that dictate growing a beard) and to ask visitors before going ahead with it, provided these things are available. ",1727653182.0
RE: Does Wernicke encefalopathy arise because of alcohol withdrawal or is it just most frequently seen in these patients?,"I think the medicolegal risk is a fair concern. Personally, it doesn’t factor into the equation. The hypoglycemic drunk in front of me is more likely to decompensate from delays in treatment of hypoglycemia than they or their family are to sue me for the theoretical risk of glucose before thiamine. It’s also a low probability that they would succeed in that suit, given the emergent condition always takes precedence over theoretical risks in emergency care (although obviously in a suit, anything can happen depending on jury selection).

point 1 is uncommon, because confabulating patients are hard to discharge and wernicke's does not go away before discharge. prolonged withdrawal delirium is (usually) easy to separate

I also think a lot of it is subtle and many make doctors would be shocked if you noted it.  Health care has objectively made major efforts to address race, ethnicity, sexual orientation etc and there has been a lot of effort to discuss implicit bias to help well intentioned people learn.

RE: New grad oncology salary negotiations,"(PA for ~decade here)… Pre-PA patient care experience and rotations during school are very unlikely to be effective bargaining chips— nothing demonstrates work competency other than actual work experience. Student rotations are not remotely the same as being on the job.  Remember salary is based on productivity and reimbursements (RVUs), and as a new grad you’ll likely be unable to bring in enough to the practice to cover your salary at first (you’ll be a net negative for a while in terms of $ until you’re able to safely increase patient load).  

 The best (only) bargaining chip for a higher salary would be the lack of PSLF —- that is a HUGE negative and would personally recommend reconsidering based on that depending on how much loans you have. The loans are a massive pain and (as someone in the last year of PSLF) —it is a godsend. You can still be in onc and get PSLF- consider academic medical centers etc  

 If you’re set on this job, consider negotiating for a bonus structure based on productivity (instead of just asking for more $ in salary)- that’ll likely be MUCH more palatable to the practice since they’ll only be dishing out extra money if you’re truly earning it, plus it incentivizes you to be productive, which is a win-win ",1727552677.0

Additionally the benefits and security are a worthwhile trade off IMO. I would not incur any additional educational debt unless you have a next step in your career pivot solidified.

Looking for a discussion or advice in what you would have done in this situation. I work in a procedural area and we unfortunately had a patient pass on our table. This was end of day and everyone stayed to help the call team code the patient and deal with the paperwork/ post mortem care. However, this patient had a daughter that was driving in from around an hour away. The nursing supervisor wanted the patients body to stay in our pre/post recovery area while waiting on family. Mind you this is after working hours and this unit is not staffed at this time. The call team was also refusing to stay with the patient and said the patient could stay in a pre-op room until family arrived. I spoke up and said that it was unacceptable to leave a dead patient in an unsecured area alone. The nursing supervisor was also okay with this plan. Am I the only one that thinks this is horrible patient care and also unsafe? How awful it would have been for the family to walk into a room with no one around and you have no idea who could walk in that room at any time completely unsupervised. Can I get some feedback on this? Does anyone have a policy for what to do in this situation? 

Follow up: the patient went to the morgue and I’m not sure that the daughter was ever able to the view the body..just the other family that was present. 😔",1727638934.0

RE: Pitt to offer “Doctor of Chiropractic” program. Where is this mystic pseudoscientific field headed?,">I am sure not every DO embraced that change, but when your profession did reach its hand out, it was taken. 

I guess that's one way of putting it. Another is the actual history.

Osteopathic medicine was founded by a traditionally trained MD (Andrew Taylor Still) near the end of the 19th century. He recognized that medicine in his time was profoundly unscientific and a hodgepodge of treatments based on anecdotes and traditions, many of which were outright harmful. His theories about subluxations and disease and the founding of his medical model on musculoskeletal manipulation as an efficacious modality wasn't any more scientific, but at least the treatments were mostly benign. 

There was no philosophical antagonism toward treatment by drugs and surgery, though. In fact, selective surgical treatments were already incorporated in the curriculum of the first osteopathic medical school in the 1890's. Dr. Still just considered much of what was available to be not well evidenced as having significant efficacy and, in fact, they appeared to him to do more harm than good. He was not entirely wrong about this. 

After the turn of the century, medicine started to become more scientifically grounded, particularly in regard to drug therapy.  With that, the osteopathic profession began to adopt treatments that had some reasonable evidence of being safe and effective. By the 30's, the AOA required osteopathic medical schools to teach pharmacology and integrate drug use into their clinical curriculum. By and large,  DO's were fully on board with adopting treatments for which there was good evidence even though there was still a strong emphasis on the benefits of OMT which was practiced by virtually every DO. 

As the first half of the 1900's was coming to an end, DO's came to believe that they were as fully trained as MDs to practice the full scope of medicine and many were even lobbying to convert their degree to a more recognized ""MD"". In the 60's, California offered them that option and almost 90% of DOs licensed by the state took advantage of that to make their dream come true. Like a jinn granting a wish, though, this backfired spectacularly on many since these new ""MDs"" were not accepted  by MD institutions, and what DOs were left in the state considered them turncoats. No other such degree swapping has been offered anywhere since.

""Separate but equal"" was the professional stance of the AOA (still is). Unfortunately, DOs were at a decided disadvantage when it came to clinical training, particularly specialty training. MDs would not allow them to practice in their facilities and osteopathic facilities were relatively few in number. And what few there were had scant specialists to train up and coming physicians. So DOs were almost entirely ""general practitioners"" who were well educated in that regard but did not have much exposure to specialty care. Still, they were reasonably competent in their role as primary care physicians.

So, primary care training for DOs has been on par with MDs for quite some time. Meanwhile, the osteopathic profession was able to increase its training infrastructure (for example, I trained at an ""osteopathic hospital"" with over 500 beds with all major specialties represented). Despite that, it's still true that osteopathic-centric hospitals are still on the average smaller and have fewer subspeciality procedures and training opportunities than MD-heavy institutions. But the gradual increase in admittance of DOs into many MD specialty training programs made the 
 sparsity of such programs at osteopathic institutions relatively irrelevant. And as of 2020, DO and MD training programs merged, further reducing this as a problem for DOs. (Although many state licensing boards still will not accept ACGME-only CME for license renewal. You *must* have a certain number of ""AOA"" credits. A portrait of protectionism.)

Division between MDs and DOs has devolved into an almost entirely political one that exists almost entirely at the organizational level. The AOA tenaciously hangs onto it's separate identity and independent certification and regulatory power with a death grip, but DOs by and large don't have any cultish devotion to their osteopathic medical degree. And MDs, who gradually came to work side by side more and more often with DOs, gradually came to mostly acknowledge that DO training is for the most part on par with their own (and not infrequently completed at MD institutions). 

>Even though some did not support it or hampered its decades-long process of change.

The AOA has played self-protectionist political games that have sometimes been an impediment, but most DOs have been on board with integrating with MDs since at least the mid-20th century.",1727209334.0

RE: 'I Don’t Want to Die.' He needed mental health care. He found a ghost network,"Training of any professional is fundamentally bottlenecked by the availability of supervising and educating professionals. You can't snap your fingers and make these come out of thin air. You can point to whatever factors in history you want, the outcome was that we are currently severely undersupplied with regard to psych professionals vs social demand. The payment models in Healthcare are also not based on any free market OR central control designed for the ""greater good."" 



Payment in US Healthcare seems to be controlled (at least) by insurers looking to profit maximally by being the middleman, a cartel of proceduralist medical specialities, and politicians seeking electoral leverage. These trends have been active for nearly a century. These trends divert talented and intelligent people to practices outside of mental health. It was up until 2015 or so that psychiatry was considered a joke of a specialty for the most stupid and lazy medical students. Yes, there will always be a few passionate and incredible clinicians, researchers, academics. But, the general desire to enter the profession has been commensurate with the pay. 



Under these conditions, how can you sustain a training program that has any quality? The hospital system looks at their books: the psychiatry services are a net negative if you examine their books alone. How can it be otherwise when the best reimbursement is for procedures? Pay for supervisors and educators in psychiatry is thus rock button low. Hospitals disband their mental health services. Clinicians leave for private practice where they can get cash pay. 


On the other hand, with psychotherapy, the opposite problem occurred. It cost nearly nothing to run a mental health master's or doctoral program, and there were endless easy student loan dollars to be harvested. 




With rapid expansion of training programs, a cargo cult will always emerge. In psychotherapy, studies of short term therapy modalities conducted on simple patients by world class experts in the treatment arm compare outcomes to no or sham treatments. Society begins to believe that psychotherapy is a treatment of didactics: merely delivering information and teaching behaviors. The ability to understand and accurately identify psychopathology further degrades. 



The government continually expands licensure in mental health treatment to address clinician shortages. This is of course cheaper than paying the clinicians. The market becomes flooded with new graduates who are not ""trained"" so much as led, blind, by the blind, or hardly led at all. 



The government and large payors then look at their outcomes. It appears there are no clear outcomes differences between highly trained and totally untrained clinicians. Or, at least none worth paying for. Anyone (legally authorized) can listen to a patient rant and vent for an hour, and anyone can read advice and exercises from a textbook. Anyone can pick a chapter of the DSM that the patient resembles and prescribe an FDA approved medication. After all, this is what the worst and the bulk of mental health professionals often do. 





Outside of true believers and maybe 40 or so academic institutions (a drop in face of the huge demand and supply for clinicians), the good and great clinicians have passed away, retired, or have moved towards accepting cash only. The shortage is so great that even a mediocre practitioner can run a cash practice. Outside of great masochism and charity, why else would one do such difficult work for so little pay? Why navigate a complex insurance system and fill out paperwork and still risk having your payments clawed back?



So here we are today: insurance pay is still not equal to other specialty medical treatment for psychiatry. Therapists and psychologists (rightly or wrongly) are reimbursed less per hour by payors (not patients) than they probably ever have been. What will we do? Pay more for poorly trained clinicians already in the field? Fund training programs to be led by the blindly trained?
 



What's the solution? There is no clear solution, or we need at least ten separate ones to start. I would personally start by expanding systems of telehealth for access and *triaging* public dollars into the most serious conditions. I would educate the public before we educate clinicians, so they may understand what is and what is not *treatment*. We will not be able to agree, as a society, as what is more or less serious until it is too late. It is always too late.",1727019676.0

As with everything insurance there are strict rules.

If the doc has never or almost never has seen the patient (on their own sched), you're likely to have insurance take issue in an audit. Ie fraud claims.

I did one rotation at a practice that did this. The doc saw every patient for initial eval and also saw each patient 1/4 office visits. 

If the doc is just in the building it doesn't mean they can never see a patient yet bill incident to (for higher reimbursement) forevermore",1727444188.0

RE: Pitt to offer “Doctor of Chiropractic” program. Where is this mystic pseudoscientific field headed?,"> Ya, except DOs are also fully trained doctors.

So will these chiropractors. Just like the PharmDs and the DPTs and the JDs and PhDs. They won't be physicians, but the majority of people who have the title doctor aren't, either.

> That's in contrast to a chiropractor who would likely do an x ray, interpret it with minimal training and no radiologist, and treat it with manipulation. Like... If you walked into a chiropractor with a spinal epidural abscess, how many of them would say ""hmm... History of IVDU and a fever? Go to the ED"" Vs ""hmmm. Take some Tylenol and let's get cracking.""

You are presuming to know the teaching and curriculum of this program. All chiropractors are not trained the same. I've chiropractors refer medical issues to me in lieu of cracking.

Will this program just be a cash grab, like many of the chiropractor schools? Maybe. Will it be a higher standard? We don't know. But it's certainly a possibility, since a major research university is conferring a professional doctorate degree.

I may have made point in a non-sensical and obtuse way. But...let's say that this program does a year of basic science, a year of general pathology, then two years of clinical rotations focused on techniques they have in common with OMT...well, that kind of looks the curriculum of a lot of professional health doctorates, with a similar grounding in evdience-based-ish diagnosis and treatment.",1727144244.0

"RE: So are there just hoards of doctors just telling every patient their symptoms are all in their heads, or they're faking, or having period pains? ","I see tons of miscommunication in healthcare every day, and tons of patients misunderstanding what they were actually told and then mis-quoting their doctor later on. For example, outpatient doctors, how often have you seen a patient for an ER follow up visit and they said ""The ER doc didn't do anything for me!"" but you read the ER note and see the blood work and imaging that was done, the IV medications given, the specialty referral placed, the medications the patient was prescribed upon discharge. I think some people just have a very skewed view of the definition of ""the doctor didn't do anything!"" or ""they told me nothing was wrong"".

Now, as many other commenters have said, there are also definitely some bad doctors out there who for whatever reason actually don't care about their patients (burnout, or just being not a great person to begin with). But i think that is not as common as many people believe. I'm Family Medicine, so i often see patients complaining of symptoms from numerous organ systems. It can take multiple visits and multiple tests to figure out whether symptom X is caused by the same disease that is causing symptom Y vs a totally separate issue. And sometimes i never get it figured out, and refer to a specialist who also can't give a good explanation for the patient's symptoms. It is common for a patient's condition to not be accurately diagnosed even after more than one visit for the complaint. It is also quite common for the patient to come to the conclusion that the first doctor they saw is incompetent because they haven't figured it out yet, then go to a second doctor (who has the benefit of knowing the results of the evaluation done by doctor #1); if doctor #2 gets the diagnosis right, then doctor #2 is, in the mind of the patient, more competent than doctor #1.

I had a patient once who came in for a same day visit complaining of chest pain, dizziness, diaphoresis, and peripheral edema. Had severely elevated BP. I sent the pt to the ER due to cardiac concerns. Negative workup for acute cardiac syndrome, started on antihypertensives and referred for outpatient Cardiology evaluation for possible CHF. At some later point, patient sees a Gynecologist who says the peripheral edema (which persisted after the other symptoms improved) might be a symptom of menopause. So, get this, the patient sends me angry web messages about not wanting me to be her doctor anymore because i was stupid enough to think her edema was heart related and i must not know anything about menopause, so i should go back to medical school. She accused me of telling her that her symptoms were ""all in her head"" though i never said anything of the sort. I guarantee you that she has told many other people that i am a bad doctor because i did not diagnose her correctly or care about her and i ""brushed her off"". Like i said before, it is probably true that some doctors really do ignore patients or ""brush them off"", but i know for an absolute fact that at least some of the time the patients are just lying when they say that, or are at best severely misinterpreting the reality of the situation.",1727289792.0

There wasn’t enough information in the post as to when wound care was called. But I can say from my first and his diaper rashes he had, if he was in the hospital and had those rashes they would’ve called wound care. But there’s nothing that anyone could’ve done to prevent those rashes. We found he was SUPER sensitive to augmentin to the point that his butt would be bleeding within minutes of that poop touching his skin. We would have to pin him down and wipe as he was screaming in pain. I told our pediatrician to never ever give him augmentin again and we listed it as an allergy. And his rash occurred within 10 minutes of his poop. So it’s entirely possible that her baby could’ve had a similar reaction that quickly but no one knew that they would’ve had the reaction until they did. So there’s just not enough details to say for certain that neglect was happening just because wound care was called.

I felt the same way when I first started emergency med. I stuck it out for 3 years and I’m grateful I did. I switched to a different specialty where I cover inpatient and clinic, and wow.

Most patients with comorbidities will have HTN, DM, CKD, HLD, CHF, COPD , a fib, pacemaker history, etc etc, etc  . You’ll do much better managing their care having a solid background in that.

For practice building, I basically figured out (coming from inpatient positions) don't try to turf a bunch of stuff out or manage it over the phone. Most patients actually prefer to follow with you to review scan results, endoscopy results, see if a treatment is working, etc. I am fine managing stuff over the phone if patients ask, but my default is that if my RN cannot manage it over the phone and patient is okay coming in, bring them in.

Second, I really did not want to follow stable patients that PCP could manage at first, I felt it was not a good use of their or my time. But actually a lot of patients want to follow annually even to just refill 1-2 meds or be told everything is fine. So I went from telling them to see me PRN to offering to follow them annually if they wanted, and most do want that.

Next thing is just to be patient. Enjoy this time now as much as you can, even though sitting around doing jack shit is often torturous, chances are in a year you will look back at this post and miss that free time.

RE: 'I Don’t Want to Die.' He needed mental health care. He found a ghost network,"Sad story. It sucks trying to find a provider for anything even as a physician, the insurance provider database websites suck and I can't imagine how much worse it would be if one were intoxicated and/or in the midst of a depressive episode. 

It's hard to say what percentage of the blame lies with the insurance provider here vs the many other factors at play including the lack of anything approaching a standardized provider database, help from social work getting him connected to care before discharge, decisions to move cities leaving behind an established provider in an effort to outrun alcohol addiction.

It's not a trivial problem to figure out which providers are still practicing and taking on new patients. Perhaps expecting each insurance company to figure this out (and each provider to communicate to each contracted insurer) is a mistake.",1727019162.0

Surgeons….,"I have a question for the masses and not sure if it really is this way or just me being hyper-observant or my environment.

I have been a PA for more than 10 years and worked in Family Medicine, ER, and UCC; currently in Ortho Surgery.

Are ortho surgeon’s decisions based completely on how they feel that day?  Like there is no consistency in their decisions?

For example: today we say no joint replacements if BMI over 40 but tomorrow we say well their weight is 250 so no joint replacement (they are 6’4” with a BMI of 34). Or I don’t like your note…change it.  So it’s changed to mirror one of their old ones (wording, not PE) and it’s still crap and has unneeded info.  Ummm…this was your note from a week ago with all the information you put in your own note.  Surgeon having a meeting with someone that admin was not there and telling me the new office policy is XYZ and admin is scratching their head as they have no clue and not sure what meeting they were talking about.  

I could go on, but with my prior background I had many interactions with docs and surgeons, but it seems ortho are their own beast and to a point a complete disrespect to the PAs.

In Family Med, yes you were the doc and I was the PA but there was a common respect.  In the ER is was similar but we were all in the trenches (felt more military like that the doc was the platoon leader and the PA was the platoon sergeant…there was respect but also knew the chain of command).  Does not feel anything like this in Ortho…just there me up here and you PAs are down there.  In the ER dealing with some of the surgeons was not like it is in the clinic.  There was a level of respect and some guidance/teaching for future cases.

Maybe I am getting too sensitive in my age, but I don’t think so and wanted to ask if it’s just me or similar elsewhere.",1727609908.0

RE: Pitt to offer “Doctor of Chiropractic” program.

I think that most of the NEWER chiropractors and the schools are maybe more interested in heading towards the PT-ish or PT adjacent route. Most of the ADJUSTMENT only research that is published is skewed towards Chiropractors with the adjusting only mentality aka the ones that say chiro cures diabetes. The other research adds exercise, PT, etc to the adjustments or the manipulations. 

I worked as a chiro for 7 years and did PT and Manips, anecdotally i can tell you that my patients that did only adjustments felt better in the short term (ie the day of and a few days later) but in the long term it wasnt as effective as adding other modalities and lifestyle changes. Granted i am talking about patients with no visceral complaints or crazy co morbidities. Just your standard, lower back pain from sitting etc.

RE: How do you reconcile 10/10 symptoms with patient behaviour?,"I would argue that it can be very useful if enough information is gathered.

Second person has 9/10 shoulder pain, only when reaching behind back, settles to 1/10 pain right after…unable to tuck in shirt, belt, difficulties with self care, still able to work, golf, etc

You ask them what their pain is, both would say 9/10 because they want you to know how much it is at its worst and how it’s affecting their life….they only get 5 minutes to sell it to you how bad it is.

Explaining to them basic pain neuroscience (ex. pain as an alarm system, can sometimes be ignored, other times important to listen to) could be more helpful…set their expectations on functional goals, encourage them to keep moving , refer to professionals for help dealing with the pain if significant like PT, CBT therapy, etc 

Do not tell them they are broken or definitely need surgery (unless obviously something major)… I see way too many people told they have a degenerative condition (like DDD, or meniscus tear, torn rotator cuff) and shouldn’t do sports anymore, run, or bend, etc….the body is designed to heal and capable of tremendous potential for activity if done in proper manner..

RE: How do you reconcile 10/10 symptoms with patient behaviour?,"Back in the day when I was young(ish) and had an intermittent enthusiasm for this job I would gently challenge patients. “So if your leg caught fire now your pain would not get any worse since it’s already 10/10? If your living brain was dipped in a vat of acid that would be the same sensation as the one you’re currently experiencing?” And that is of course a completely meaningless exercise. 

There’s in my opinion three kinds of patients that report 10/10 or 9/10 while being objectively not in any distress. 

1) the chronic pain patients who have just given up and always say 10 because they suffer (and they really do) and wish to express this. These patients will also often say that their worst pain is a 16/10 ie beyond the ken of mortal men. “10/10 is a good day for me” I’ve been told.

2) patients who want narcs but can’t even be bothered to put on a good show of actually being in pain. 

3) patient’s who have had the very nasty experience of a, say 6-7/10 and want to communicate that this is scary and not something they’re used to and want to impress upon us that this is really really worrying to them. Here I’ve sometimes had success with asking them to differentiate between how worried they are about the pain and how severe the pain is in itself. “If you knew the cause of the pain, say that we find an appendicitis, would this make the pain more tolerable?”

RE: Florida Department of Health emergently suspends license of physician who removed liver instead of spleen.,"Definitely a solid place for training and one of the better ones. Especially when compared to some of the bottom tier hospitals across the country. I would rank it medium tier and that’s still fairly incredibly tough to get into especially for him being a DO, he would have to have at least above average board scores to be able to a secure spot there. Don’t think his training was an issue. He went several years (15 I think?) without any incidences in Bama at all. He wasn’t a Duntsch. I’m thinking he was having some sort of personal crisis (drugs, exhaustion, fatigue..). Like others mentioned any sane person would have left the liver alone after he cut into the IVC. There’s a million ways you can explain why you cut into the IVC. Patient had mega colon and you couldn’t see the anatomy properly or he wasn’t properly anesthetized and jerked or IVC was displaced, or IVC had a aneurysm. Idk it’s a whole lot easier to explain IVC injury which would be in the realm of rare complication than to take out a liver which is like 0% risk of complication of having your entire liver taken out during a splenectomy. It would raised more than a few eyebrows, sure, he would have been sued at best.  But it wouldn’t be as huge of a blunder as to go ahead and take the liver out and label it as spleen. That part just doesn’t make sense. When patient is coding, you stop surgery and efforts go towards stabilizing patient. I don’t know shit about surgery, I hate ORs. But if one of shittiest and only gen surg rotation taught me anything it was to cauterize, and if it can’t be cauterized you clamp a bleeding vessel and suture it to control bleeding.  That’s what I would have done, initiated massive transfusion protocol and then begged on my knees to get cardiothoracic to get their ass in the OR STAT!

"Tomorrow is my last day working urgent care, and good lord am I relieved to be leaving this specialty ","Not in a million years would I be thinking I'd be posting that headline 4 years ago when I graduated PA school, already completed 2 different urgent care rotations and was eager to get in and get to work. I loved the urgent care setting a lot as a student, enough so I chose to use my 2 elective rotations to do 2 different urgent care rotations. Both of my urgent care rotations were done before COVID.  I graduated at the height of the pandemic (summer 2020) and was thrown into the front lines. 

I started at an urgent care that I actually completed one of my urgent care rotations at, so I was comfortable and familiar with the place. I moved to a smaller, privately owned urgent care 2 years ago (current job). My first job utilized STAT labs, CT, even MRI - therefore we got some pretty high acuity sh\*t that we had to work up (unsafe much?, but great learning experience as a new grad), so I moved to the other urgent care which only had point of care testing and no stat labs or fancy imaging... also closer to home, better pay etc. 

Granted, the perception of a student is WAY different from an actual PA-C working of course - but as a student, I recall that before the pandemic, cases were a) urgent care appropriate, b) None of that ""My primary care doctor sent me here because they couldn't help/see/listen to me"" BS, and c) patients were just way more considerate and receptive to whatever medical advise you had to give. (Ok ok, that last one yes, patients could have been taking my/my preceptor's advice as a grain of salt, but NO ONE was flat out rude and outspoken like they are now. Patients will fight me tooth and nail about even the smallest recommendations I give). 

I could ramble on and on about numerous frustrations in my daily work day, but bottom line - urgent care definitely started as a nice addition to our healthcare system, to help people get quick care for acute, non complicated things. Now?, I feel like post COVID especially, urgent cares have come to just become the dustpan of not only PCP care, but specialty care as well. Numerous patients tell me ""My doctor told me to come here"", most of them saying that their PCP told them to TELL ME, THE PROVIDER, that the patient ""Needs a Chest X ray"" or, ""Needs a prescription for X""... Okay, why don't you order that yourself??. Etc. 

I bet my experience encompasses a lot of other medical professionals out there in all sorts of specialties aside from urgent care...  and I know that I'm probably gonna get a little backlash from assuming thinks were peachy pre-COVID, they definitely were not because HELLO American healthcare system but... COVID just propelled everything into a different universe, mostly causing a huge distrust in our healthcare system and causing patients to question us and our motives. It is really sad.

RE: Pitt to offer “Doctor of Chiropractic” program. Where is this mystic pseudoscientific field headed?,"Not sure how familiar you are with Chiropractic, but if you’d allow, I’d like to (briefly) expand. 

Firstly, I’d acknowledge what others have indicated on this program and it’s possibly a cash grab. I will also acknowledge my profession hasn’t done itself favors in many regards. I’ll also skip over most of my other commentary, at least for now. Final bit, I’m not licensed in PA and don’t know its specifics. 

However, an important part of being a DC is that anyone’s with any condition can come into our office without a referral. I get that many here (and Reddit in general) disagree with that, but that is the reality. And it’s important to understand what that means: a non-chiropractic patient will come into a chiropractor’s office and that chiropractor needs to know when the current treatment for a patient is out of their scope of treatment, despite being inside the realm of what they are expected to recognize and provide a differential diagnosis. 

In that regard, I can’t think of a better place than within medicine to incorporate the training of recognizing these things. I wasn’t evidence-based when I started, but absolutely was before I had finished my chiropractic program. Even the AMA acknowledges benefits of chiropractic - in specific circumstances. 

Where does some of the health-based research come from? Sounds like some would say not this university, but if the other option was chiropractic colleges, which would provide better evidence? 

There are more chiros who are anti-evidence than I want to acknowledge. But, within the profession, the faction growing the fastest is evidence-based. Most schools have gone away from teaching that, regardless of symptoms and presentation, we should x-ray every patient before starting care. That is in line with the changes in the evidence. Emphasizing the diagnosis and the musculoskeletal nature of the care we provide is also following the evidence.

RE: How do you reconcile 10/10 symptoms with patient behaviour?,"When I ask pain level, I generally try to make sure I clarify what a ""0"" means and what a ""10"" means. On a scale from 0-10, 0 being no pain at all, 10 being the worst pain you have ever experienced in your life. Helping put into context what these numbers mean has helped get more accurate measures of their pain. That being said, ""pain"" is in the eye of the beholder, and I always ask, ""who am I to judge someones pain tolerance?""

We provided medication regardless of how we qualified their pain, if we thought that our patient could benefit.

I'm not a big fan of withholding pain medication. If someone is drug seeking and is dependent, what could this patient do if we didn't provide them with medication? Go to the streets to get something that could be laced with fentanyl potentially risking their life or unknowingly overdosing? At least if we manage their medication, we can keep an eye on them. I think good pain management involves taking a good history, understanding their perspective, and using your best judgment.

DEA requires all narcotics to be accounted for. Make sure your documentation is accurate. I am assuming you work with an electronic MAR. Document the dose as given at the time you gave it. Follow your mangers instruction to use the ""bar code unavailable"" option. You have now legally accounted for your narcotic. 

As far as what happens now. Generally nothing. Electronic MARs and pyxis/omnicell machines generate a lot of data about how we pull and pass narcotics. Users whose behavior repeatedly varies from typical behavior get flagged. They may then proceed to audit you and/or watch your behavior. 

But really, in this case, it is super unlikely anything will happen. Packaging gets damaged, the MAR acts up, meds need to be given during downtime. Just remember to slow down and finish your documentation when giving meds. ",1727711624.0

"RE: So are there just hoards of doctors just telling every patient their symptoms are all in their heads, or they're faking, or having period pains? ","Often this is a result of a disconnect between patient expectations and the limitations of medical care. A majority of acute symptoms do not get a definitive diagnosis upon initial presentation. Clinicians are trained to initially evaluate for any potentially serious/life or limb threatening condition followed by consideration a differential list of conditions gradually decreasing in severity. And often it is tincture of time that is the best diagnostic modality because most relatively minor symptoms will resolve with conservative management. Thus the ubiquitous Rx and come back if the symptoms worsen or don't resolve. This method of management is particularly prevalent for acute pain syndromes. However, many patients see the failure of the doc to get an immediate and definitive diagnosis with effective treatment as an abject failure of that physician to appropriately diagnose and treat even if - especially if - the correct diagnosis is made on subsequent followup and testing. And then the patient interpretation of such a situation is that the doctor thinks the pain or symptom is not real etc etc if no diagnosis can be found. Of course there is some truth buried underneath these comments. Modern point-of-care practice focuses on volume over quality and so necessity of efficiency in these practices leads to shorter visits and more conservative care plans ergo Rx and come back if the Sx is still there.

RE: Pitt to offer “Doctor of Chiropractic” program. Where is this mystic pseudoscientific field headed?,"Chiropractic is pseudoscience?!

In the mid-19th century, Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis demonstrated that hand washing could drastically reduce maternal deaths from puerperal fever in maternity wards. Despite clear evidence, the medical establishment at the time rejected his findings. It wasn’t until decades later, after his death, that his approach was accepted.

For centuries, bloodletting was a common medical practice based on the belief that it could cure a wide range of illnesses by balancing the body’s “humors.” This treatment, now known to be dangerous and largely ineffective, was standard until well into the 19th century.

In the 1950s and 1960s, thalidomide was marketed as a safe drug for treating morning sickness in pregnant women. Unfortunately, it caused severe birth defects in thousands of babies. The tragedy revealed major gaps in drug regulation and led to stricter safety protocols for pharmaceutical approval.

Lobotomies were once considered a legitimate treatment for mental illness, particularly for conditions like schizophrenia or severe depression. Developed in the 1930s, the procedure became widely used in the 1940s and 1950s before it was discredited. It often left patients with severe impairments or personality changes, and its wide adoption is now seen as a significant failure of medical ethics.

While antibiotics have saved countless lives, their overuse has contributed to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In the early years of their discovery, antibiotics were prescribed liberally, often unnecessarily, leading to the current global health challenge of drug-resistant infections.

For many years, hormone replacement therapy was widely prescribed to postmenopausal women to protect against heart disease and osteoporosis. However, large studies in the early 2000s revealed that HRT could increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and breast cancer in some women, leading to a significant re-evaluation of the treatment.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, pharmaceutical companies aggressively marketed opioid painkillers, downplaying the risk of addiction. Many doctors were convinced these medications were safe for treating chronic pain, leading to widespread overprescription and the opioid crisis, which has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths due to overdose and addiction.

Tonsillectomies, the surgical removal of the tonsils, were once one of the most common surgeries performed on children, often for relatively mild reasons like sore throats or frequent colds. Over time, evidence showed that the procedure was often unnecessary, and today, it is far less commonly performed.

While ECT is still used in modern psychiatry (in much safer and more controlled ways), its early use was often extreme and poorly understood. In the mid-20th century, it was sometimes applied without anesthesia, causing patients significant distress and trauma. The misuse of ECT became a symbol of the harsh treatment of mental illness in that era.

Diethylstilbestrol (DES) was a synthetic estrogen prescribed to pregnant women between the 1940s and 1970s, believed to prevent miscarriage. However, it was later discovered that DES caused cancer and other serious health problems in the children of women who took the drug. This led to a major medical scandal and increased scrutiny of drug safety in pregnancy.

Chiropractic has very pseudoscience upbringing’s but the research has transformed into a more conservative approach to MSK healthcare. These moments mentioned above, while painful, have often led to greater reforms, stricter regulations, and a better understanding of the human body and medicine. However, they serve as reminders that the medical field is constantly evolving, and humility and openness to new evidence are essential.

-Communicate the plan of care with us. 90% of the time I find out a patient is getting admitted, the doctor has not told me the reasoning of the admission.

Lots of opportunities to be on-call for census reasons if I want to skip half a shift or so. Compared to other hospital bedside jobs it’s a unicorn unit. 

The thing is I still hate it. I’m really introverted and thought I could fake it til I make it but truth is 1.5 years in I can’t. It’s extremely draining for me and I don’t like being a nurse. I’m also working night shifts which is ruining my life but I can’t afford to take the pay cut of days + I’d be even more miserable working days because of how busy it is. I tried OR right out of school and hated it and transferred which is how I ended up bedside, even though I said in school I’d never do bedside. My plan was OR all along but even that fell through. 

Thing is, my mother-in-law-to-be just offered us her old house since they’ve moved. Mortgage + all utilities would be $1k less a month for a house than we’re paying now for an apartment. It’s in our hometown some hour away; cost of living is less and wages are more or less the same. 

My fiancée wants to move and I’d be with her except I’m terrified to change jobs. On one hand I don’t like my job, but it’s a predictable dislike. I will never work a hospital bedside position again because if my unit is the best it gets I don’t want to try anything else. I hate night shifts but my fiancée and I are regardless moving in 1.5 years for her to go to professional school so it’d only be a little bit more of nights because I’ll never take a night shift position again either.

Thing is I’m terrified of trying to find a job somewhere else and hating my life even more. I could try a M-F but what if I hate it more than 3 12s and I miss having 4 days off?

Every organization in this unfortunate story is following their incentives. This insurance company saved more with his death than they would have paid for his treatment and maintenance. Regulatory fees are cheaper than compliance. Psychiatrists and therapists are taking better-paying patients. Hospitals are treating acute issues and discharging. Rehab is restricting access to improve outcomes. Legal action only occurs in the worst cases or from wealthy clientele, who aren't as affected by these issues in the first place due to cash based concierge services and better insurance.

Will a Nursing Externship Boost My Chances of Landing an RN Job Out of State?,"Hi and thank you for reading!

I have my first externship interview coming up next week, and I’m excited but a bit nervous. I’ve done quite a bit of research on nurse externships, and it’s definitely something I want to pursue as part of my long-term career goals.

Currently, I live in the Midwest, but my ultimate goal is to work in California, specifically in Orange County. I’m nervous about how competitive it is to land a job there because I’ve heard California is a wonderful place to work as a nurse. I’m curious to know how viable it is for a new grad like me to get a job in Orange County.

My plan is that if I can get an externship, it will help strengthen my resume and increase my chances of getting a job in California. I’m also thinking about applying to nurse residency programs in my final semester to get more clarity and connection to potential opportunities in California. Worst-case scenario, I can stay in the Midwest and try to land a job through my externship after I graduate and pass the NCLEX.

I have a couple of other questions I hope you all can help with:

1. If I go forward with an externship here in the Midwest, is there an expectation that I’ll stay and work at that hospital afterward? Would it hurt my chances of getting a good reference if I left to pursue a job in California? I’m worried about potentially damaging the relationship with the hospital if I don’t plan on staying long-term.
2. If I take this externship (I’m about 7 months away from graduating from my accelerated nursing program), does the externship count toward nursing experience? For example, if I work for 7 months as an extern, does that count as 7 months of nursing experience on my resume, or is it considered just externship experience?

Also, I feel like this might not be the best question to ask potential employers directly during my interview, which is why I’m turning to Reddit for advice! I’d really appreciate any insights you all have.

Please let me know if my plan is solid or if I’m misunderstanding something. I’d love to be corrected at this stage because I’m still mapping out my decisions to ultimately reach my life goal. Thanks!",1727632300.0

- Help us with minor things. Get them into a gown and on the monitor while you assess them. Get them a cup of water, a blanket, some snacks, etc...

RE: How do you reconcile 10/10 symptoms with patient behaviour?,"I use the Objective Pain and Distress Scale

Verbal
- 0: Cannot Point to Pain

- 2: Points to Specific Area

Vitals
- 0: No Change in VS
- 1: Change in HR / BP 10-20% of the norm

Crying
- 0: Not Crying

Agitation

- 2: Inconsolable Agitation

Movement
- 0: No Guarding

- 2: Involuntary Guarding or Constant Movement to find Position of Comfort

I read about this scale maybe 10-15 years ago in a research paper. I loved it and I’ve used it ever since.

- Basically everyone agrees that a 10 is a 10.
- Most patients are a 3; a 2 for verbal and a “pity point” (credit to my partner) somewhere else.
- It is usable in almost all patients, even children and the elderly, and it doesn’t require that they have the cognitive ability to score their pain.
- the only argument I’ve heard against it is some version of “WOULD YOU WANT SOMEONE TO USE THAT ON YOU?!” Yes. In fact, that’s the checklist I go through when determining what answer I’m going to give when people ask me. Because all pain is bad. The 1-10 doesn’t make sense to me.
- the main argument for me has less to do with patients exaggerating and more to do with the fact that, whether I like it or not, I am more likely to medicate sympathetic populations: the little old ladies, the cancer patients, the very young, etc. This minimizes my bias.

Need Major Advice,"Hi yall this might be long so bear with me. 

I currently work at the hospital as a PCA, I am getting my CNA this week and back in January was doing my prerequisites for nursing school when my life changed course drastically. I got into a bad sledding accident that left me hospitalized for 17 days and in an inpatient rehab center for 47. In June or July I was able to walk for the first time. I finally started back at work this month and now am wanting to return back to school. However I have NO IDEA what my best course of action would be for going to nursing school. 

Originally I was doing my prerequisites and planned on doing a two year RN program and then eventually getting my BSN after. I’ve completed some but still have my full course of anatomy classes to finish as well as making up the other two classes I was unable to finish due to my accident during winter term. 

That being said, I thought about returning back and going along with the original plan however due to my accident I didn’t apply for financial aide this year and would end up having to pay out of pocket if I returned back for winter and spring term. I would also then take longer and have to take summer and fall classes next year as well as possibly winter. Meaning I wouldn’t be able to start my cohort until 2026. 

I feel so impatient but it seems so far away now I’m having a hard time staying motivated. I’ve beaten myself up a lot after the accident as I feel I have none of my stuff together. Not to mention the financial aide aspect. That being said I there is a college nearby that is only 3 years for your BSN and any credits you had from another school will transfer. They don’t require you to do your prerequisites as it’s included in the program and the admittance is based on essays interviews and what not. They also have multiple cohorts going simultaneously (every ten weeks or something like that) so I could start much sooner if I got accepted. The downside is this school is known for being difficult due to poor communication and a lot of independent work. It’s also 96,000 dollars in total. Which while it is about the price of a normal four year BSN near me it’s still so much money I’m having a hard time comprehending it. Not to mention an RN program would only cost me about 25,000 and it would be cheaper to do my RN-BSN after. But the 3 year college is also hybrid which is helpful for me due to my schedule and driving abilities. I don’t know I’m just a little loss and could really use some guidance and motivation. What would you do if you were in my situation? 


Also if someone could please explain to me how student loans worked out for yall. Does it start after you graduate or before? I thought after but some of this stuff I’ve been reading is confusing. I’m just a bit overwhelmed. 


Thank you and sorry for it being so long! 

Edit: Also I realized another option would be to do the all or as many prereqs as I can at my current college and still apply to both two years and the three year program as if I did go to the three year program it would save me some money. ",1727682566.0

Patient stated no bowel movement for approx. a week (pre + post op), no passing gas either and also was experiencing abdominal pain. Only peppermint water was given. On day 8 the pt was given an enema due to an impaction.

Personally, I do still check those patients Q15 as much as I can, but I chart “alternatives to sitter -> increased frequency of nursing rounds” because I’m not gonna lie and chart that I’m actually 1:1 when I’m not.

This all leads to lower revenue. Some research has found that patients treated by women physicians had lower readmission rates than those treated by men, which can lower costs for health systems. These practice approaches are important aspects of patient-centered care. In a system that pays for the quantity of services provided, rather than the quality of care, women — or any physicians who provide patient-centered care — may be at a disadvantage.

Your own study pointed it out. But nowhere did you mention it was controlled for.

The issue is with the incentives behind what drives care. If it's quantity and revenue then doctors who see more patients get paid more.",1727407187.0

RE: Should I quit my job or tough it out?,"I think the fact that you're not fired means they still think you can do it. It's not like it's incredibly difficult to make up a reason to fire you. If they told you this, then you should be asking them what their recommendation is to get you to be where you should be -- reading up on study material, patient load, education, etc.

Then once they tell you what to improve on, make sure to take notes and sell to them every step of your progress. For example, if they say your differentials are too narrow, go into up-to-date and make a template for ""evaluation of xxx"". Then the next day run the template past your SP and ask if there is anything to add/remove. With that feedback, you'll get a feel for how the expectations of the clinic are and align yourself with those expectations.

I worked as a clerk before PA school with an ED doc once who was brand new out of residency. When he would admit a patient, he ran tests that I never heard of and admit patients with diagnoses that I had never heard of either. For example, most ED docs would admit with a diagnosis ""chest pain"". He would admit for ""rule out myocarditis vs demand ischemia vs ACS"". He was helping out the hospitalists immensely, but his wait times exceeded the average physician times because the tests he would run and time spent on admission ddx. Well, he was nearly fired because his wait times were longer than everyone else's and, unbeknownst to him, wait times were that physician groups most important metric. He was doing everything right except communicating with his bosses about their expectations for the position. Perhaps you are in this type of situation.

It's not uncommon for people to spend their first few months getting accustomed to the pace of a new clinic/working environment. A difference in pace between clinic preference and your preference isn't a sign that you need to get out, but rather it should be a sign that you gotta step it up a bit. Maybe cut out the fat in your patient education. Maybe tighten up or broaden your ddx (up-to-date is awesome for broadening, cutting out zebras it an easy way to tighten).

Not all of them.  The female ones.  Apparently.

This is your friendly reminder that it's standard of care not to provide any anesthetic for a colposcopy, a procedure where a literal chunk of flesh is carved out of part of your reproductive system, and that until a month ago, it was not standard of care to provide anesthetic for IUD insertion despite widespread attestation to it being agonizingly painful.

A physician doesn't have to be a bastard or openly antagonistic to women to routinely torture women and disregard their suffering.  A physician doesn't even have to be male.  One of the most eye-opening experiences of my Reddit life was being a fly on the wall over in r/residents, listening to a bunch of women obgyn residents discuss, ""Hey, uh, so why *don't* we use any sort of anesthetic for colposcopies?""

But, of course, there are physicians (including women physicians) who do have contempt for women patients and their pain.  It can be very quiet and not announce itself.  It can just manifest in warmly patronizing ""reassurance"" that nothing is really wrong, delivered in advance of any assessment, imaging, or testing whatsoever.

I got records from the outside facility that showed she got ekg and troponin x2, a chest x-ray, a d dimer as well as other basic labs.

RE: SEASONED NURSES PLEASE GIVE ADVICE,"First, it sounds a bit like you’ve made up your mind and you’re hoping that someone else will tell you it’s OK to do. This isn’t wrong and even if this is the case, I’ll say it — It’s OK to pick the more acute hospital.

What you need to be OK with is that you go into it knowing that your 12 hour shifts may really end up being 13-14, that you may not get a proper lunch based on the description, and that you’re more likely to burn out more quickly. 

Do you know the units turn over? You may also find, after a few months in, you end up being one of the “experienced” nurses on your shift. Even as an experienced RN, that’s a signal to run.

If you are OK with the above or OK with jumping ship early if you decide it’s too painful, then you’ve gone into it with what you need to know.

That said, having psychological safety is essential for good learning. Maslow’s hierarchy of needs applies to being able to learn and manage the self care necessary to recover from the work. 

The first two years as a nurse are some of the hardest — even if you’ve worked on the unit or in the hospital before.

The US obviously has widely disparate insurance companies that don’t have any control individually.  This plus the insane cost of advertising direct to consumer leads to monopolistic type behaviour.

Deposition Questions,"**EDIT: A whole bunch of fuss about nothing, as the case settled out two days after they sent me the subpoena.**  
  
Hey y'all, I searched to see what had already been asked, but it was pretty scarce so figured I'd see if I could get any other answers.

I was served a subpoena to be a fact witness in a case. None of the rendering providers involved, myself included, have been named as defendants. I have three main questions.

1. I am no longer working for the same employer but would like to review the chart/records from that patient encounter ahead of the deposition. To muddy the waters a bit, though, I was working in an ED at the time, but employed by a CMG rather than by the hospital itself. Who would I reach out to in order to get those records? **The law firm requesting the deposition already had the records available and was able to provide my notes to me more quickly than either my former hospital or CMG.**
2. I would like to either discuss the deposition ahead of time with a lawyer, or have one present during the deposition. I don't foresee being added to the defendant list, but would like to cover my bases. Since this happened while employed elsewhere, is this something that my old employer's legal team and/or malpractice coverage would do for me? Or is this where I look for outside counsel? **My current employer reached out to their legal team to provide someone to speak to about this ahead time, and the CMG that used to employ me also put me in touch with their legal team to answer my questions and go over how to approach the deposition.**
3. As a fact witness, I know that there can be payment/fees involved, but I'm not sure what a fair amount would be. I will need to take time off from work in order to complete the deposition. I know a couple of malpractice defense attorneys that I can ask to get their take, but wanted to hear from this community, too. **In Illinois where I'm located, fact witness have a standard rate of $20/day and $0.20 per mile traveled, but the requesting party can pay higher rates at their discretion for the value of time spent.**

"RE: New PA job - having second thoughts, anxious","I’m also a new grad starting off in a specialty, and I started my job about 5 weeks ago! My training is 6 months long, but after 5 weeks I already feel so much more comfortable than I did when I started (and when I started I was terrified truthfully). By no means do I think I’m an expert, and I am thankful to have more time to train; but I think if I had to be on my own starting tomorrow, I’d be ok. I say that because I’ve learned a ton, but more importantly I have fostered great relationships with the docs I’m working with, and have collected tons of resources to reference as needed. I feel like I can consult them whenever needed, and that’s a huge benefit when starting off in a specialty. 

I think it would be worth asking for additional training time — maybe you could have your own patients on the 2 days your MD is gone, and then spend the other 3 days with him for an additional time period after your 4 weeks of “training.” That could be a good compromise for both you and the practice, and you could build up to being completely on your own. 

That being said, if that’s not an option, I would glean as much as you can from your first 4 weeks, find some solid Allergy/Asthma/Immunology resources, and then have an honest conversation with your MD so he knows where you’re at and can be there to support you, even when he’s not in clinic. 

Ultimately I think if your MD is training you and deems you ready for clinic in 4 weeks then you will be just fine. You might have to spend more time studying and charting than the average new grad at first, but I think it will be a great learning experience and make you an even stronger clinician.

I can't say I don't have any support either, because technically there is a full time doctor, but how much one person can ask for help? 

I have more troubles answering the questions from the nurses all night, as that is my duty as a cross-coverage person. I am only surviving due to the best pharmacists in my hospital, I don't know what would have happened without them. I wish I had somebody to talk to ; whenever I see first year medical residents  I get a little jealous because they are always there with the 3rd year. But in my hospital, I am all by myself, trying to figure it out on my own. 

I don't even know if I am doing the right thing- for example initially pt presents with hyperphos, then on his few nights at the hospital he gets critically low phos, and nurse messages me to replenish, and I am replenishing it, is that ok? I don't have time to read the charts or notes because there will be back-to-back nurses messaging me in the early morning and the progress notes are not clear cut either. Or I have a knowledge gap. 

I get stuck when they message me about bradycardia, or tele is showing them junctional rhythm, or mobiz type 1, and my doctor is not around, not responding, have their own ""shit show running"". All I do is tell the nurse if the pt is symptomatic or not (thank God no one has ever told me symptomatic). 

Now i am even starting to question how much fluids to give, the other day some doctor left with continuous fluid and I had to give them lasik. How much damage I am doing by giving people dilaudid or morphine or ketorolac? Nurses asks for pain meds and I just send the order. 

Is this just a learning curve, or there are better ways to learn without getting stuck or trying so hard to figure out?

Least you could do is throw out the sharps and throw out the trash. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve almost cut myself on bloody sharps because they’re hidden under dirty gauze. 

- bundling orders. I’m sure others below have already mentioned it but if someone is gonna need a full work up and treatment, I’d rather go in the room ready with all my supplies and do everything I need to do in 30-60 min than have to constantly be coming in and out of room, grabbing supplies, meds, new tubes, etc because you keep putting a new order in every 10 min.

"New PA job - having second thoughts, anxious","Need to vent to a community that understands what I’m feeling. New grad PA about to start my first job. Signed on with a busy Allergy, Asthma, Immunology clinic, scheduled to work M-F 40 hrs a week. No weekends or call. Landed with a good doc and staff, but since signing the other PA has quit and when I start next week it will only be the MD and me.

The real kicker is that I only will receive 4 weeks of “training,” and during those training weeks the MD will be absent two days a week. After training, I see patients on a full schedule 5 days a week and, again, the MD will only be present 3 days a week. Which means as a brand new provider, I will be by myself two days a week in a busy allergy clinic with barely any training.

Am I overthinking this? I am so nervous. I feel like I picked the right job but ever since hearing the other PA left I have regretted signing the contract.

I would not want either of those jobs if I had significant joint problems.

But non-surgical jobs pretty much you are sitting or standing. You do walk more as a PA than an office job but nothing physically demanding. We are not doing much (or sometimes any) bedside care like nurses or nurse aides that would be bad on our backs.

"RE: NPs sue NY for not being paid the same as physicians, stating it is due to ""gender discrimination"". Thoughts?","Most women want to have kids, and want to actually spend time with their kids.

It also means accepting 0.4 and 0.5 FTE schedules with a huge decrease in pay even hour by hour or by wRVU. Men might want to have kids but we've all heard the often true stereotypes of surgeons for example not being there for major milestones in the kid's lives as a result.  It's a tradeoff with major consequences on either side, but being very available as a physician work wise means higher pay and a terrible schedule.  This isn't to say either is wrong, but there are huge costs on either side that any individual has to pick what downside they can deal with.  The flipside is for women to think about their husband going 0.4 FTE at a 60% paycut to take care of the kids while they are the primary breadwinners.  A few choose that, but not the majority.

RE: How do you reconcile 10/10 symptoms with patient behaviour?,"My perspective from the ER is people get the benefit of the doubt at least until w/u is back.

Chronic patient are little more complicated. Sickle Cell is the classic example in EM. Again, I give the benefit of the doubt, they have real disease that can cause real pain. That being said if it is someone coming in multiple days in a row and refusing admission/refusing to trial oral meds etc... I will start pushing back.

RE: Venting,"Coming from a family of first responders, no one is terribly sensitive in my circles, but I have noticed that when I get particularly gripy about my patients, it’s time to cut back and take some time off. 

Sometimes, if not most of the time, venting gets me in a negative headspace, and having been in counseling for burnout, I know where that will lead. 

It weird, right? I mean, the reason we call it venting is because it’s what we do to “let off steam” when we are stressed, but there comes a point where it stops helping and really just makes us miserable, and tends to make the people around us miserable too. 

It’s a tough career. I don’t really hang out with other PAs or NPs. More than anything, I prefer to hang out with my old paramedic co-workers from my EMS days. There’s just something isolating about being a PA. 

Anyway, one thing I learned from my counseling was that my venting about patients really had more to do with unrealized anxiety and unmet expectations. Learning to manage those things better made the frustrations from my patients have less of an effect on me, and over time, I lost the need to vent.

""According to staff, when patient W.B.’s abdomen was opened, a megacolon − or an abnormal dilation of the colon − ""burst out of the abdominal cavity, disrupting visibility,” an incident FDOH says Shaknovsky did not document.

“While OR staff cleared the field by moving the large colon and suctioning blood, Shaknovsky identified a vessel that he intended to cut and noted that he could feel it pulsing under his finger. He told the staff member assisting him, ‘that’s scary.’ Shaknovsky grabbed the vessel, positioned a surgical stapling device around it, and fired the stapler,” the emergency order described. “Immediately after performing the dissection, patient W.B. began to severely hemorrhage and went into cardiac arrest. OR staff members observed a significant amount of blood pouring out, immediately disrupting visibility in the field.”

While staff began efforts to save the patient’s life, Shaknovsky “stayed in the patient’s abdomen and continued dissecting even though the abdomen was full of blood and there was no visibility.” The report said he did not ask staff for a clamp or cauterizer and fired the stapling device “blindly” into the patient’s abdomen. He eventually removed the man’s liver and identified it as his spleen, the order said.

**Man dies on operating table:**[Alabama man dies in Destin hospital after surgeon removes wrong organ. How it happened.](https://www.thedestinlog.com/story/news/local/2024/09/03/florida-surgeon-dr-thomas-shaknovsky-removed-alabama-man-liver-instead-of-spleen-in-destin/75054297007/)

“Spleens and livers are anatomically distinct, have different consistencies, and are different colors,” the emergency order notes. “Additionally, the spleen is located on the left side of the abdomen while the liver is on the right side. The staff looked at the readily identifiable liver on the table and were shocked when Dr. Shaknovsky told them it was a spleen. One staff member felt sick to their stomach.”

Despite the staff’s “best efforts,” the report said, the patient passed. FDOH said Shaknovsky requested the organ be labeled as a “spleen” and sent to pathology and although the person responsible for labeling it knew it was not a spleen they “did as they were instructed.” According to staff, Shaknovsky then left the operating room but returned three times after that, each time stating that the patient's “splenic artery aneurysm ruptured and that was what caused the bleeding.”

“The staff in the room felt that Dr. Shaknovsky was attempting to convince them that this is what occurred, even though they witnessed something different,” the order said.

During the autopsy, the medical examiner noted that patient W.B.’s spleen was still intact and that his liver was missing. The medical examiner also noted that the inferior vena cava had been severed, which is the largest vein in the body and brings deoxygenated blood from the body back to the heart for new oxygen. The inferior vena cava connects the liver to the heart.

“Based on these findings, Dr. Shaknovsky dissected patient W.B.’s inferior vena cava, resulting in the bleeding event that precipitated his death,” the emergency order said.""

RE: Deposition Questions,"You need to talk to a lawyer. Either one you pay a fee to consult with or the lawyer of the defendant if you feel that is appropriate, though if there is ANY chance you could be targeted in the suit, you really need your own lawyer who is looking out soley for you. If at all possible you should have a phone or video call with a lawyer before the deposition where you are prepared for what will be asked and how to respond.

In a deposition, the less information you provide, the better (in general). The biggest mistake you can often make is to talk more than necessary. If a question can be answered by yes/no, just state yes/no and be quiet. If you are unsure if a question was appropriate to be asked, ideally a lawyer on your side there is involved and you can nod to them or ask them how to proceed. When replying, treat it like writing the most CYA chart ever. Be vague when appropriate, do not overstep what you could factually know, and do not implicate anyone (especially yourself) when instead things could be left to uncertainty.

As you brought up any chance of being added to the defendant list, I would absolutely not go about looking to be compensated for this. Your only priority should be to protect your license.

Hope this winds up being a whole bunch of nothing. Court stuff sucks, even if you are not the one who has something to lose. Just keep your cool and pause before answering and think before speaking.

RE: How do you reconcile 10/10 symptoms with patient behaviour?,"I have worked in pharmacy since 2008. You would be surprised what people will overuse. Several patients run out of their Wellbutrin too early. We have 2 patients right now that we treat it like a control for and only allow it a few days early. Propranolol is another. Imitrex, too. Fioricet and Fiorinal, even though some butalbital products aren't controlled. 

Plenty of people lose their birth controls and Lisinopril. We just get them an override with their insurance and they use a refill. Their doctors never know. Insurance also allows really early refills on non controls. Some medicare d plans allow you to refill when you are at 65%. That's almost a month early on a 3 month supply. 

Not that opiates aren't misused. Trust me. My store doesn't even stock oxycodone 30 mg anymore, and we keep hitting ordering limits and are unable to order many opiates. And other stores won't fill for our patients bc they have their own limits. The pendulum has swung way too far. There are very few new opiate patients these days. Most of these people have been on them for years. Holding people to the 30th day is mean, and many pharmacies do this now.

Best handheld ultrasound for hospital medicine?,"I'm an academic hospitalist working in a high-acuity institution. I've got some stipend/department money to use, and have been looking into getting a handheld ultrasound.

Unfortunately, our access to decent ultrasound machines has always been fraught, of the ""there's a machine somewhere on the floor, maybe try the micu?"" variety. We also bed two to a room (!!!) so getting a machine physically inside is usually a struggle.

I trained just before ultrasound really came into its own on the floors, so my experience is basically non-existent beyond the once a year courses we get on them, which I retain basically nothing from due to lack of application.

RE: Is it inappropriate to shave a comatose patient?,"Hello. CRNA here who worked trauma/transplant/surgical ICU for many years. 

1.) when it comes to grooming and basic care, Consent is implied if they are comatose, and lying in a hospital bed. 
2.) shaving isn’t surgery or a permanent removal of anything that won’t grow back. It’s only facial hair. It grows back very fast. 
3.) patients always do better when they feel better. 
4.) I’ve always seen a positive physiological response to grooming (bathing, hair washing, a foot massage, shaving a man’s face). Patients rest and heal when they FEEL better. And everyone feels better when our bodies are clean and well cared for. A comatose patient cannot attend to their own needs. As nurses, we are the ones that need to care for all of their needs, including grooming. 

Bathing and grooming patients was required back when I was an ICU nurse. It was an expectation of the nurses job. It was done every night shift. All patients got a bath. If you had time to shave and wash their hair, even better. If they were there long enough, you trimmed their nails too.

RE: Does Wernicke encefalopathy arise because of alcohol withdrawal or is it just most frequently seen in these patients?,"From UTD:

“Thiamine is a cofactor for several key enzymes important in energy metabolism, including transketolase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase [1]. Thiamine requirements depend on metabolic rate, with the greatest need during periods of high metabolic demand and high glucose intake. This is manifest by the precipitation of WE in susceptible patients by administration of intravenous (IV) glucose before thiamine supplementation [33].

Evidence for the role of thiamine in WE is supported by observations that the thiamine antagonist pyrithiamine causes experimental thiamine deficiency in rats, resulting in a sequence of ataxia, loss of the righting reflex, and convulsions [34,35]. In some cases, low levels of magnesium, an essential cofactor of thiamine into its active diphosphate and triphosphate forms, have been implicated with thiamine deficiency in WE [36].

Because of the role of thiamine in cerebral energy utilization, it has been proposed that its deficiency initiates neuronal injury by inhibiting metabolism in brain regions with high metabolic requirements and high thiamine turnover. Events such as blood-brain barrier breakdown, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor-mediated excitotoxicity, and increased reactive oxygen species have been implicated in thiamine deficiency-induced neurotoxicity [37].

Thiamine deficiency in individuals with chronic heavy alcohol use results from a combination of inadequate dietary intake, reduced gastrointestinal absorption, decreased hepatic storage, and impaired utilization [38].

Not all thiamine-deficient individuals with chronic heavy alcohol use develop WE. Greater susceptibility among identical rather than fraternal twins suggests a genetic predisposition [37]. Investigators have found that in individuals with chronic heavy alcohol use and WE, the thiamine-dependent enzyme transketolase has an altered affinity for thiamine [39-47]. Variants in the high-affinity thiamine transporter gene have also been implicated [48,49].”

My last ortho practice was very close knit and we all supported each other. I only left because I didn’t like taking call as much as the job required.


Ortho is still in a large growth period across the board. It produces lots of money so lots of innovation and many practices are establishing new standards of care. Also as new studies come out, practices should be changing.

Previously every joint case was done in the hospital now most can be done same day in the ASC. With robotics and newer implants you can push the BMI limits and as surgeons become more comfortable across their career they will adapt. Also if it is a slow period they want to still earn they will sometimes be forced to take on cases they wouldn’t normally do.

I make absolutely certain that I tell my patients that I cannot make their pain zero, I can't make it a go away because it's part of the underlying disease process. But if I can make it tolerable then that's my goal. 

On the other hand, if I observe that patients are excessively sleeping too during the day, severely constipated or difficult to arouse, then those are my obvious indications to pull back.

Typically, even with my patients who have chronic pain or chronic opiate dependence, I find that discussing this approach with them takes off a lot of stress and conflict than me feeling their 10 out of 10 pain looks pretty comfortable from the door to the room.

You can look at community colleges, liberal arts colleges and teach bio, A & P, general studies. You can also teach adjunct.

New Grad Fast Track EM Training ,"Hi all! I was offered a fast track EM job at a teaching hospital. I haven’t shadowed the place yet but I just got a tour of the ED today. We’re in the process of scheduling a shadowing day but I wanted to give them a decision about the offer. They are looking to hiring 4 candidates so that we would be on rotating shifts. The fast track area is connected to triage so I will be expected to help with triage if needed. It’s also connected to the main ED but I won’t be responsible for those patients. I was told that shadowing period would be 2-3 weeks and then you’re on your own but you have support from the attending who will be in the main ED. 

My biggest thing I’m worried about is that it’s my first job and I feel like 2-3 weeks of training is really short. I want to ask for at least 2-3 months because I think it will be overwhelming to get used to the EMR, working up patients, reading imaging, etc. I feel like this is a big red flag that their training is this short and I don’t know if they would be willing to really extend it even if they say ok if I ask.

Having a spouse or family NOT in healthcare is tough, and to be honest with you, even when your spouse or family is in healthcare, they still sometimes do not get it.

They don't get that we are trained to be objective when dealing with patients, and that doing so is the only way to provide the best care. They don't understand that when you deal with life and death all day, making a joke about dying is either a way of coping or just a reflection of your day in day out work. They also don't understand that when you have to tell a patient and their family that a 20, 30, 40 or 50 year old is dying, that seeing a 70 or 80 year old die to you, it's pretty normal to think ""I mean, they made it to average, what's the big deal?"" Or after telling someone they have an incurable cancer, it's kind of hard for your next visit to show a bunch of fake compassion about unresolved ankle pain or neuropathy or whatever. It does not make you a bad person. Our jobs do this to us. We have to think like this to do our jobs.

Honestly, sometimes I think we should not even try to talk about our work with non-healthcare providers (or a step further, if you are doing acute care or in a field with a lot of mortality, to talk with those also dealing with such matters). They are flat out NOT going to get it, no matter how much you try to explain things to them.

Can I just rant for a second? ,"Hey everybody I’m a private duty peds nurse and have been working my current case since the end of July. I relocated back to my home state a few months ago, so I’ve only been with my agency since the beginning of July. I can’t stand my current case. I guess if I start from day one, Mom never gave me any in home training. I showed up on my first day, she handed me the patient, and stayed in her room until my shift was over and she needed to sign my charting. The patient is not medically complex and the most “nurse” thing I do during my shift is my baseline assessment and change a g button dressing, but showing me how you like your child to be cared for is bare minimum. The agency provides skills training but patient specific training is on the family/ other nurses in the home. This was a brand new case for the agency and I am the only nurse on the case. 

The Mom hardly communicates with me, on most occasions it’s just a good morning when she opens the door upon my arrival and that’s it. I’m not a chatty person myself, so that doesn’t bother me but there are other things she does not communicate with me. My patient has a few different services that come during the week and Mom never tells me when they’re coming (they do not come on the same days/times each week), and I am in the home alone with the patient for the majority of my shift. It’s uncomfortable to have someone show up unexpectedly to a home that is not mine. Most of the time, the other services will show up while the patient is napping (they’re under a year old) so I’ll have to interrupt her sleep and deal with a very fussy baby later. The patient has had one doctors appointment since I’ve started and Mom didn’t mention the appointment until the day before. She also didn’t mention that we would be taking public transportation (The bus and train) to get to said appointment, I didn’t realize until we walked out of the house and stood at the bus stop. I didn’t have cash on me, but luckily our city has an app and you can buy your tickets that way. I didn’t have an issue with this, it just would’ve been nice for her to tell me.I have mentioned to the agency that Mom does not communicate with me and nothing has come of it. 

Mom did ask me back in August after one of my shifts if I could come in an hour early for the next TWO WEEKS, as her other child has no transportation for school and she would need to take them on the bus herself. I agreed, since it would only be for two weeks, but as of this week, this will make it WEEK SEVEN that I have been coming in at 7am instead of 8am. Mom has not given me any updates this entire time. My agency came out to the home on Monday for a visit and I mentioned it to them, told them I would like to go back to the original schedule, and they said they would reach out to Mom. agency reached out to Mom a few days later and emailed me saying Mom still needs me to come in at 7am and that they’re sorry for any inconvenience. I know an hour may seem like no big deal to most people but I’m over it and I only agreed to this for 2 weeks. 

Mom has also left me in the home with the patient with no baby formula for the first 3 hours of my shift and as of last week no baby food to give in between formula feeds. She also locks the feeding pump in her room when she’s not in the home, so the every 3 hour feeds are stretched farther apart if the patient is napping. 

When I started with the agency, I had a high tech night shift case, but I could not get into the swing of night shift so I was given this case. I feel like a babysitter and I dread my shifts everyday. I feel bad asking to be removed from this case since I asked to be removed from the night shift case back in July. I don’t want to seem difficult and risk my job. I’m almost 21 weeks pregnant and need a consistent source of income. I also know the likelihood of finding a replacement nurse is not likely because of the neighborhood the patient lives in, and the home not being in the best condition, on top of Mom just starting to work. If I leave the case she would likely have to quit her job. I feel stuck in this case and I can’t stand it.

I know this was lengthy so thank you to anyone who read this all the way through.",1727619994.0
"RE: So are there just hoards of doctors just telling every patient their symptoms are all in their heads, or they're faking, or having period pains?

RE: Question about Billing as a PA and working in a place predominantly NP-based,"These are the rules for incident to billing, recently updated by CMS.  This is copied and pasted from their website.

In order to bill a service as incident-to, the [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/clm104c12.pdf) has several requirements, including that: 

* Only established patients seen by a credentialed NPP for a follow-up appointment can be billed as incident-to
* The supervising physician must be present in the office suite when services are being rendered by the NPP
* The supervising physician must actively participate in the course of treatment
* The medical services must take place in a noninstitutional setting (e.g., Place of Service 11)
* Both the NPP and the supervising physician must be credentialed by Medicare; and
* The NPP must be an employee of the supervising physician’s practice 

Incident-to billing is not consistent with CMS rules if:

* The patient is new
* An established patient presents with new medical complaints 
* Only one provider is credentialed by Medicare (e.g., the physician is credentialed but the NPP is not); or
* The supervising physician is not present in the office suite

  
So simply put; the physician needs to be in the office at the time of the visit, the patient cannot be new to the practice nor can an established patient be seen for a new complaint.  In those situations where incident-to billing applies; you bill like normal, though the practice will bill under the physician's NPI.  In any of those exclusionary scenarios, the patient is billed under your NPI.

Technically, you will always chart and bill like you normally do.  This is on the admin/billing staff to sort.",1727467624.0

Interview Nephrology Prep New Grad,"Hi! I know that it’s been posted probably numerous times already what types of questions to prepare for as a new grad about to interview with the Supervising Physician, but I’d love to ask about specifically the specialty of Nephrology.

"RE: So are there just hoards of doctors just telling every patient their symptoms are all in their heads, or they're faking, or having period pains? ","I think it's multifactorial. Yes, there are some docs who are quick to jump on the anxiety/weight/period excuse train. I, myself was told by my pediatrician that my knee pain was due to being overweight and I needed to exercise more. He had apparently forgotten that he sees me every year for sports physicals for year-round varsity sports. And as many have pointed out, women's issues are often the worst when it comes to misdiagnosis and medical gaslighting. The only situation in which we routinely do biopsies without any anesthetic (not even local) is the cervix/vagina; it takes an average of >5 years of excruciating ""period pain"" before a diagnosis of endometriosis is made. I've seen multiple patients put on anxiety meds before tests for thyroid function are done (and found abnormal).

That being said there's definitely an element of misperception on the part of the patients. There's a belief  that we should know what's going on and be able to run all the tests right now. This seems especially true in the ED. Patients will come in for subacute or chronic problems and expect that I can run every test they need right then and there. Despite my best efforts to explain that we've reached the diagnostic limit of the ED and their PCP/specialist needs to take the baton for the next leg of investigation, that still often gets misinterpreted as saying there's nothing wrong with them. I have literally said to a patient ""I believe there's something going on, and I don't know what it is."" just to have the patient immediately say ""So you're saying there's nothing wrong with me"".

RE: Question for ED Nurses from an ED Doctor,"This. 

I work in an ED where none of our docs communicate with us regarding plan of care and this results in not only delayed patient care but built up frustration between both professions. It will save everyone a lot of time if you quickly have a 20 second chat with the bedside nurse before you see the patient and say “any concerns.” This allows us to mention concerns and for us to relay our assessment and understand a plan of care. Moreover, if we need something for nausea or pain that isn’t urgent we can voice that which will save you a lot of time so you don’t have someone bothering you every two seconds. You won’t be clicking in and out of charts for everyone concern that someone brings to you at a random moment. In my ED docs are constantly interrupted which frustrates them resulting in conflict for something that the patient needs. This angers nursing because get insulted or talked down to for addressing patient needs and when people stand up for themselves it becomes blown of proportion. If a culture established where everyone knows that you’ll talk to the team then people won’t bother you for non urgent issues and instead have all their information ready to present when you come by. Lots the time if you say “any concerns” the answer will be no if everyone is being diligent and addressing those concerns.

I've worked with a number of NPs over the years, they are a mixed bag, not unlike physicians.  One who just left our group should have been fired years ago.  The stuff I've discovered while taking over part of her panel makes me shudder. None of it is about brains, it's all about attention and giving a shit, but I have seen MD/DOs like that, too.  I would argue a smaller proportion, but they exist.

Another NP spent the three years of COVID in the ICU and when the medical director said I had to precept her for  minor procedures (ones I had trained her in before she went to the ICU) I told them to get stuffed.  She spent three years intubating people, putting in central lines, etc.  I was fairly sure she could handle inserting and removing contraceptive devices again.  Which she did.  I would hire her anywhere, anytime, for pretty much anything.

For mid-levels I generally prefer PAs, who at this point can't go to school on-line, but a friend of mine who is a Vietnam-era PA points out that PAs are trained in our model, are either ex-military independent duty corpsmen who went on to PA as a way to utilize their skills civilian-side, most of the younger ones I've met didn't WANT to be doctors.

One instructor said that everyone had their families brought into the hospital, including pets. Local nearby families had brought over everything in their fridge and freezers and made them home cooked meals daily (as the food would’ve gone bad at their homes anyways). She said that the hospital had OPEN BARS for staff when they were off. 
Her and her husband stayed in an office for days with their dog and she says her patient load was less than her usual one. 

Another instructor told us about his best friend who was at charity and had to wear plain clothes and deny being a nurse because she had been held at gun point multiple times by people who wanted drugs; she ended up leaving nursing after the hurricane because of the PTSD she suffered from even wearing her scrubs. 

I was a kid when Katrina hit and I remember the chaos of the national guard riding and walking around with big ass guns and machine guns mounted to cars. I remember everything being damaged and closed and the absolute eerie absence of light at night- with even scarier sounds. My single mom only stayed a couple of days and we ended up bouncing around to different states to anyone that would have us- and sleeping in the car at rest stops or putting cheap motels on a credit card because she said the city just wasn’t safe for us to stay.

RE: New Grad Fast Track EM Training ,"As someone who works both main ED and fast track, I will say the definition of ""fast track patient"" as defined by triage nurse has changed dramatically over the past few years. Part of this is new grad RNs/travelers who don't know what they don't know. Some of this is just zero beds in the main ED and nurse management pushing throughput - patient has to go somewhere, their vital signs are stable, let's call them an ESI 4 and the PA can figure it out. But they are going to push some bullshit into your rooms on a daily basis.",1727445549.0
RE: 'I Don’t Want to Die.' He needed mental health care. He found a ghost network,"Yeah it's truly idiotic. I wonder if because he was checking into residential and not detox, they didn't want even a tiny chance of dealing with withdrawal - which would be incredibly easy to assess clinically and work around.  Unfortunately there are so many idiotic policies in our field, many arising from a basis in stigma or a punitive/carceral paradigm. Like the entire existence of the methadone clinic industry. And the X-waiver. Our patients also have a lot of trouble advocating for themselves. The poor guy in this article actually had his mom as a powerful advocate and he still fell through the cracks. Most of our patients have no one, and if they die, they have no one to raise the alarm about how they were treated.",1727037174.0
Med error,"Hello everyone, I’m so scared to talk about it but I really wanna get this out of my chest. I did a med error earlier, I gave 10 mg of morphine instead of 10 mg oxycodone. I’ve told the doctor and told me to just monitor the pt. Pt was okay, he just had an amputation on his lt foot and was taking oxycodone q3h. I’ve reported an incident report and I’m really terrified bc I just had a talk with my clinical educator due to a near miss I did a month ago. I feel so dumb and exhausted, I thought I was having a great shift til it was in the end. :(",1727674317.0
RE: Med error,"You're not dumb. You made a mistake. And then you took all the right steps to take accountability for that mistake and ensure that no harm came to the patient as a result of it. It happens. Learn from it. Figure out how it happened, what could've been done to prevent it, and then let it go and move on from it. Don't beat yourself up over it, it wasn't on purpose.",1727700670.0
RE: Question about Billing as a PA and working in a place predominantly NP-based,"What they are talking about is billing “incident to” or billing independently. If you bill “incident to” (incident to the physician treating the patient) they bill for 100% or close. When you bill as an APP they get reimbursed at 85%. They’ll tell you what to do, I don’t think it changes how you code, it would be how they put the bill through. Look up “incident to” in Medicaid/Medicare billing.",1727431761.0
RE: If you had any doubts that the American health consumer is being hosed ... ,"I find it unhelpful and disingenuous when you say that congress ""loves 'investigating'"". With out these CEOs on TV, the average American isn't reading your scholarly article or even the NYT headline. This is a condensed, newsworthy item to bring up on the 5pm local news - which has the highest viewership and if we're lucky, there will be some non-political answer from a CEO that drives tiktok engagement.  
The question that is now more important than ever for any practitioner is: do you want to have a hand in solving your pt's problems?  
Ex: My wife's a dentist at an FQHC look alike. She wants to solve problems with her patients and she's very involved with certain lobbying institutions that should be pushing for change in the industry. What are the old timers interested in that currently control the reigns of power at the ADA? non-compete contracts, paperwork free medicare coverage, blocking student loan forgiveness, and expansion of scope for midlevels.  
Get involved in whatever lobbying group you can. Say things, put them out there. The AMA isn't currently lobbying for PSLF. That should be a no-brainer in regards to being able to pay for med school, unless you're rich. The AMA isn't currently lobbying for low RX drug costs, again, no brainer. These are things you could advocate for, but it takes more than posting on reddit.",1727227154.0
"RE: So are there just hoards of doctors just telling every patient their symptoms are all in their heads, or they're faking, or having period pains? ","I think it’s both.

RE: Nurses- how do you cope with making mistakes?,"Sometimes it’s not your fault. It could be a systems issue or policy issue.

Always good to file an incident report to avoid future mistakes. But, don’t take it too hard. If you catch your mistake early, admit it. If your patient ends up being harmed look for ways to resolve the issue.",1727649716.0
