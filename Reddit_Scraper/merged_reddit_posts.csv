RE: Why is underdosage of anesthesia and pain management so common?,"I'm not sure. I haven't witnessed any as a nurse. Before I became a nurse, I was patient. And then, as a nurse, I had an adenomyosis. My doctor was not aware that I was a nurse.

My experience with a female doctor was a nightmare—months and months of being tormented with pain around my menstrual cycle. I wasn’t sure why she was this way. She was my OBGYN who didn’t want to prescribe me contraception but would instead order narcotic medication I didn’t like. I explained to her I could not have this medication based on my experience with its side effects.  I don’t like being drowsy and would get stomach pain. I’m not too fond of the feeling of it. Anyway, she sent me for a vaginal ultrasound to find the source of my pelvic pain. It was “normal.”  She stopped here. I asked for the pill. She declined to renew it after 12-month of supply. I felt a lot better with this, so I stuck with it.

I found a male OBGYN. He diagnosed me with adenomyosis. It was a tiny part of my uterus that got affected. It hurt like hell. The doctor told me that if contraception didn’t work, surgery would be the last choice if I wanted to get rid of the pain. My life has been great since I started taking pills regularly.

I think privilege is an issue as well, and that's something that isn't necessarily discussed and it's something we can be completely unaware of despite good intentions. We can say ""I'm not biased!"" while being ignorant of privilege. In my own case, when I was pregnant in grad school, the linguistics and anthropology departments I was in worked closely with some of the med school professors (20+ years ago they were trying to design ""virtual patients"" for the med school, and there were MD/PhD programs in med anth and public health, as well). So I was introduced to my maternal-fetal medicine specialist by first name and treated collegially in a way that I had no idea wasn't normal--I had nothing to compare it to. Over a decade later, when I returned to grad school to focus more on bio anth/evolutionary medicine and related my story, which included teasing banter with the geneticist and sh!t like that, during a discussion of birth trauma, the professor basically jumped down my throat, and I was humbled--which was fine with me! I love learning new things, and I have no problem being wrong. But she basically used my experience as a jumping off point to talk about socioeconomic disparities to obstetric care, and lit my fuse as a social justice warrior. Some things we just don't see until someone points them out to us--and all the bias training in the world won't help us see our own privilege until we are open to seeing it.

And I think that comes back to what you're saying about ableism. People who can pull 48 hour shifts \[or can they? really?\] may not realize that that is privilege, not the norm, not something to measure others by.",1727302567.0

It has many, many hospital campuses throughout the state, none of which are actually affected by the storm, just the community around this specific one. They are not hurting for money. They asked for volunteers to go 3 hours away to help work nights at this hospital. Lodging at the hospital included...meaning a shared conference room or something. (Obviously the hotels are full, that isn't the issue.) But to not offer crisis pay or incentive pay or anything beyond base pay?!?

Maybe I'm just really selfish with my sleep (I have a hard time sleeping anywhere other than my bed, am effected my any noise or light, can't sleep with snoring, and will wake up easily and not get back to sleep.

All while paying us shit, never giving us raises to reflect what we do more and more or matching cost of living, never giving us incentive pay, and guilting us into picking up extra shifts or extra roles to make up the slack!

"RE: NPs sue NY for not being paid the same as physicians, stating it is due to ""gender discrimination"". Thoughts?","I’m an NP and live in Canada where I'm tied to a physician for consultative purposes ONLY if I need help with a diagnosis or treatment plan, which the requirement will be changing very soon because we have enough NPs to take over that role for new graduates. Also, we have the ability to curbside consult specialists just as a GP would. I practice completely independently to the scope of a GP. The GP has no say over my practice and is not responsible for my practice in any manner. But I would never expect to be paid the same amount. Like 75%? I'd be happy with. 

I'm with the physicians on this one. I didn't have to sacrifice my 20s and early 30s for my career. I started off with a good paying job as an RN after graduation. And now as an NP my patient benchmarks and roster are like half what a physician has to see. But that being said, I think the education argument becomes less once an NP has been practising for several years - considering we don't just graduate and stop learning (if you're a good NP). And the education in Canada is pretty rigorous and standardized and there is more regulation coming down the pipeline that will improve it more. 

That being said, I’m relating this to a family physician, not a different specialty. I’d never agree with NP basic education being similar to another specialist without having additional didactic and residency experience equivalent to that specialist’s post grad requirements.   

Plus, aren’t these NPs required to have supervision by an MD? They are not independent then. You can’t expect to be paid independent wages when someone else’s license is at stake.

Kaiser got a nice cushy contract with the state to supply Medicaid coverage, but patients already in the Kaiser system already struggle to get in with their PCPs and if they need a specialist it's an added struggle. When I did locums last year I paid for kaiser. I was not able to get into a primary and kaiser refused to pay for my adhd medication because I didn't have a kaiser psychiatrist, which likely would have taken over a year to establish.

18. The field of nursing has been, and remains, predominantly female.

19. In 2013, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that 90% of registered nurses
were women. See United States Department of Labor, Women’s Bureau, 30 Leading Occupations of Employed Women, 2013 Annual Averages, https://www.dol.gov/wb/stats/ leadoccupations.htm.

20. Nursing involves the performance of duties that require heavy physical exertion, as well as a tremendous amount of physical effort, on a daily basis.

21. Nurses’ daily physical responsibilities include lifting, moving, turning, transferring, supporting and restraining patients, many of whom are heavy, sometimes mentally ill or intoxicated, and even combative. The majority of a nurse’s workday involves walking or standing. Moreover, nurses are vulnerable to workplace violence, in particular, physical assault from patients or patient family members.

22. The physical nature of performing nursing duties substantially increases the risk of back injuries. Nurses suffer a disproportionate number of musculoskeletal disorders during their careers, stemming from the cumulative effect of repeated manual handling of patients.

23. More than half of nurses complain of chronic back pain and 38% of nurses sustain
significant back injuries that require leave from work.

RE: How do you reconcile 10/10 symptoms with patient behaviour?,">Legit question, why?

Because it's disingenuous and irresponsible to pretend that lexapro and dilaudid have identical risk profiles, whether for typical use or severity of withdrawal symptoms.

>SSRI’s cause withdrawal too but you are ok with that?

Yes? Why wouldn't I be? SSRI withdrawal is far easier to prevent/taper than opioid withdrawal. And the morbidity from SSRI withdrawal is far less severe than with opioid withdrawal.

>now it’s pounded into everyone’s head that it’s going to make everyone an addict.

Agreed. MDs are too scared of opioids.

>But again not everyone that is on an opioid medication is misusing it

Agree, and I never said they were.

>even if there is chemical dependence that is just the nature of some medications.

And it is the nature of some medications that the *degree* of chemical dependence is far higher than it is with other meds.

I think you've misread me as an opioid gatekeeper. When really my point was, you can't throw all dependencies into the same category and dismiss them or accept them on the same terms. Some patients are dependent on opioids in a negative way, others are dependent in a positive way (or at least in a neutral way). Replace ""opioids"" with ""SSRIs"" and that statement is still true. *However,* all the data we have (and our best understanding of neurochemical pathways), tells us that opioid dependence is much more *relatively* dangerous than SSRI dependence.

Like i said, the more philosophical question of whether America is focused on the wrong dependencies, is entirely valid and worth discussing. But it's a different question from whether certain dependencies are more medically dangerous than others.",1727388004.0

GI complaints? That’s the anxiety. Vision issues? Migraines…from anxiety. Involuntary movement? Run a quick EEG…but assume FND.

It can even cloud interpretation of “objective” test results, e.g. B12 deficient? Probably excessive alcohol consumption…because anxiety. They’re on an SSRI, after all.

How many times has someone told you a story that ""the doctor told us he would NEVER WALK AGAIN""? This is not how medical professionals deliver difficult news but I have heard this story at least two dozen times from different people. 

When I was working on COVID vaccination from the social services side, we had a weird tension in how physicians communicate and how patients receive them. The nurses and doctors would say-- reasonably-- ""this will significantly reduce the risk of you catching COVID, and if you do catch COVID, you're much less likely to be seriously unwell. Tomorrow, you might have a sore arm or maybe a low fever."" And the clients would hear this and come see me five minutes later and say **SHOULD I DO IT? THEY TOLD ME IT WOULD MAKE ME HAVE A SERIOUS FEVER AND ARM PROBLEMS.** I had to tell people: yes, you should do it. You should get the vaccine today.

A subset of pain-specific patients\* are hoping, I think, for one of two things:

*\*not all, obviously-- usually the internety ones*

* ""Oh, you're presenting with XYZQ? I will run you through the most expensive scanner known to man. This scanner will generate a test with a 100% definitive, undeniable, 100% perfectly accurate result. It will be indisputable. I will then give you X pill which will 100% cure this perfectly.""

RE: Need some reassurance after my first day ,"Look, I get it.  Yes, I was there once.  Since then I have trained, proctored and mentored many PA’s through the years.  Every one of us were overwhelmed initially.  The fact is, though, that we have to hit the ground running from day one. There really is no break in period.  

In general, PA’s are coming out of school much younger and less experienced in healthcare and also in the workplace as a whole.  I was 36, had owned a business and spent many years in the workforce by the time I became a PA.  I was one of the younger students in my class who were manly RN’s,  paramedics and other experienced healthcare professionals.

No employer will ask you to know the job completely on day one but they will expect a certain foundation of confidence and knowledge.  You will be expected to learn the job asap.  If someone is training you, they are taking time out of their day that they don’t have.  Respect that.

It may upset some by hearing  my take but I’m just stating facts as I know them. You’ve entered a profession where MD’s stake their license on you, fellow PA’s rely on you and patients look to you to care for them. 

MD’s get years of training to prepare for the day they assume the responsibility of being an expert in their discipline.  They have the highest expectations for competence the day they start their first job.  That’s stress, man.  We are trained as generalist who become certified and then specialize on the job with no detailed training.  I’ve seen many PA’s fail not because they didn’t have good base knowledge but because they weren’t prepared mentally.

I’ve worked ortho, Derm, ER, ENT and cardiology before settling in general surgery. To me, that’s the beauty of being a PA.  We can work anywhere.  As you gain experience, each change becomes less stressful making any change a bit less traumatic.  Knowledge will come over time.  You got to get your mentality in line now. 

Certainly the workplace has changed since I began.  Those old physicians and surgeons I worked for were a crusty bunch and hard to get along with. Those that even knew what a PA was didn’t really trust or respect PA’s.  We earned any respect they had for us over time by showing competence because if we were not competent we were gone. Period.

You’ve entered the PA profession at a good time. Hard working competent PA’s paved your way.   PA’s now have more opportunity than we ever had back then. Like I said in my first response, I don’t mean to be disrespectful.  

I know this turned into a lecture.  Sorry for that but obviously you struck a nerve. This is just my experience over 30 years.  Take from it what you want.

RE: How do you reconcile 10/10 symptoms with patient behaviour?,"In the inpatient setting, we can look at objective measures to compare pain levels before and after being medicated: NIBP, respiratory rate, HR, if they’re sleeping, do they look drowsy, etc. If you wake a pt up and they immediately report 10/10 and then fall back asleep, then your spidey sense should tingle a little bit. 

In both settings, there’s obviously a highly subjective nature to the question. Having people describe their pain (rather than rating 1-10), and asking then how it impacts their functional status is important. A chronic 8/10 may go to work everyday and stay active. An acute 8/10 process may not be able to get out of bed. Pain should be treated, but that doesn’t just mean narcotics. Multi-modal analgesia is crucial. Scheduled Tylenol, NSAIDs, TENS, gabapentin, lidocaine patches, voltaren, PT/OT referrals even alternative therapies like acupuncture, Thai chi, hypnotism (that’s right I said it!). Inpatient therapies can add epidurals, nerve blocks and ketamine infusions if it’s acute trauma pain, ischemic pain, post surgical pain.

I know there’s a lot of resistance from patients to doing anything other than narcotics (“x,y,z thing just doesn’t work on me”), especially when it comes to movement, PT/OT, but as a clinician, we absolutely need patient buy-in to do the hard  and/or annoying things like scheduling OTCs and engaging PT.

","> Are there legions of doctors that exist somewhere who just tell all patients that they’re faking, or whatever else the complaints online call out???

Yes. And I don’t think it’s malicious. I think it’s burnout. You begin to internally triage more and more. You need to expend your energy on the person who is legitimately quite ill or complex, is compliant with meds, and is not an AH to you. I’ve heard a lot of “I’ve never seen someone die from pain. 😂” from doctors when patients are probably legitimately suffering (ruptured cyst, for example, or a pediatric burn patient)

> …do their personalities completely flip when I’m not interacting with them, and they become huge assholes to every patient???

Some of them. These I would categorize as the more sociopathic / malicious ones. Often men towards women. These are probably your same colleagues who beat their wives.

Oh, yeah, sorry. I’m 100% sure those exist too in some quantity. And this is also not intended to call these individuals evil. Those situations evolve over time, and are caused by numerous small factors which become larger issues over time.

> Seriously, though, where do all these comments come from?

Ok. So, a few quick anecdotes from my professional experience:

A full doctor (MD), who looks very alarmed and in a patient care handoff tells me, “She’s obviously having a heart attack. So I gave her some nitro paste and she’s on oxygen, and I’ve given her some aspirin, and we’re transferring her out.” I was with the 911 system at the time, not a transfer service. But that was the least egregious bit of this, as the EKG was clear and the patient had Bell’s Palsy. I said, “O.K., thank you.”, cause… TF do you even say to that? You’re not just in the wrong ballpark, you’re off playing volleyball.

An MD gave a 100 lb 20-something RN with chronic pancreatitis 4 of Dilaudid, then called 911 when she stopped breathing, then as I’m working the respiratory arrest, they come in *to give her more morphine for the transport so she’s comfortable*. “Ummm… I have narcotics I can give her if she complains of pain, it’s ok, thanks.”

An MD was attempting to treat pneumonia with albuterol and mag and couldn’t understand why he wasn’t seeing improvement. No antibiotics given, despite availability. Patients pressure was 80/40 and heart rate was in the 150s when I picked them up. I didn’t talk to him.

Two things to learn from this: 1) if I don’t ask you questions, I probably don’t agree with your treatment. 2) these are the things I remember the best not because this is indicative of how doctors are, but inherently because they are outliers. Patients can see 100 doctors 100 times, but it’s the 1 doctor that 1 time who is rude or dismissive that they will remember

I think patients for whom this is possibly legitimately true are also more likely to be online. We’ve all had them. The patient who complains of chest pain but really they’re just seeking or lonely and then one day they DO have a (cocaine induced) MI and they go, “SEE?! I told you I was having heart problems!!!!”

I think the confluence of these last two factors can really make some online spaces feel demoralizing.",1727281786.0

Just need to listen to your coworkers holding PRN or not telling the MD current pain meds are inadequate, when someone labeled a junky is there. In undeniable orthopedic pain, just so you can’t claim they are just drug seeking.

The job needs to get done. The job is to debrief that cyst. More local anesthetic isn’t essential to getting the job done, and the patient being in pain can thus be ignored.

Looking For Career Advice,"First, I want to give a shout out to all you hard working nurses out there, much respect for your hard work.

I am located in Canada.

My life took an unexpected nose dive in the last few years and I have had to make a lot of unexpected and difficult life changes. I find myself in a bit of a career conundrum and would appreciate opinions from those in the field of nursing.

I have worked in healthcare for around 15 years now. I started off as a Dietitian but the job market wasn't great so I went back and got my Sonographer designation. I have been scanning for almost a decade now. I also taught for a couple years. During this time I got my Masters in clinical education and teaching. In my class, I was the only non-nurse. 

As I was completing all the coursework I found the various jobs, experiences, and work that my classmates were doing fascinating. I found my passion was definitely in teaching and research, and how to improve overall healthcare systems and organizations.

Along with the major life changes I also ended up having to deal with a handful of serious health issues that have opened my eyes to the fact that, long term, I am going to be looking at having to go into a job that is not fully patient facing/has some sort of office/brainwork component and not all physical.

And this is when I found that my career choice was a complete dud. Despite my years of patient care, leadership, starting up a rural clinic, teaching etc....everything I have looked at in healthcare that would fit the long term goal requires you to have an RN.

I even saw a career advisor and looked at what I would need to branch off into some sort of corporate work...and once again hit a dead end. Apparently no one sees the skillset of a sonographer as being translatable to anything but being a sonographer.

There is a program close to me where I would qualify to enter the accelerated nursing program and could get the RN designation in about two years.

I would appreciate the thoughts of the group? And please be honest (I know healthcare can be the voyage of the damned at times)

I am late 30's and a lot of things have not gone as planned. So I am trying to do as much research as I can before I make any decisions. And this is the most practical approach so far (I also found out with the Master's I have I could qualify for a post grad NP route as well).

So, am I out to lunch? Or is this a decent plan for the long term?

That's in contrast to a chiropractor who would likely do an x ray, interpret it with minimal training and no radiologist, and treat it with manipulation.

Like... If you walked into a chiropractor with a spinal epidural abscess, how many of them would say ""hmm... History of IVDU and a fever? Go to the ED"" Vs ""hmmm. Take some Tylenol and let's get cracking.""

RE: Question for ED Nurses from an ED Doctor,"*My brother in Christ...*

I’ve been a night shift CT tech in trauma centers for over a decade and this is SUCH a problem. There’s usually 1-2 of us (even at massive academic facilities with 1,500+ beds and 100+ ER rooms), sometimes 1 doing both CT and XR, transporting and sliding every ER patient to and from the department 2-3x each. And that’s not counting having to drop everything for a stroke or trauma, and fit in those timed neuro heads, allergy preps, and any other surprises from the floor throughout the night, all while the work list continues to grow.

Please, if at all possible, put all imaging orders in at once. Not only is it hard on the patient with rib/spine/pelvic fractures to bounce back and forth to the table(s) unnecessarily (if you’re ordering a pan scan and order everything but a c-spine, and we ask if you want that done while we have them on the scanner, it’s because we know it’s going to be placed either by you or someone else 20 minutes later), but we’re so abysmally understaffed at damn near every facility (and i’ve worked at hella different health systems at this point), and spending the majority of our time physically moving humans, that it keeps us from getting any other patient in the hospital done.

It blows my mind that with how stat every CT scan is, how pivotal they are to getting damn near every single patient moved through the ER and beyond, the amount of money they bring in, and how we get called literally every 3-5 minutes asking, “When are you getting _____?” “How many are in front of _____?” “This one has been waiting _____.” “Why hasn’t _____ been read yet?” (Best I can do is give you the number for the reading room, completely out of our hands, sorry.) “What’s going on with all of these scans that need done?” but no one in admin has come to the conclusion that we might need some extra fucking help.

"RE: So are there just hoards of doctors just telling every patient their symptoms are all in their heads, or they're faking, or having period pains? ","A big part is the perception of the patient vs perception of the provider. 

As an ER doc I can't tell you the number of times I'll sit down and explain findings of a w/u only to have the nurse grab me 5 minutes later because ""the patient wants to know what is going on."" Or people come in with an expectation that we are going to find a clear diagnosis and/r completely resolve there symptoms and freak out when we don't find anything emergent and discharge them with out patient follow-up.

Furthermore, I think there is a priming effect but on the patient end.

RE: Florida Department of Health emergently suspends license of physician who removed liver instead of spleen.,"After having read multiple articles regarding this tragic case and the Order of emergency suspension (as a non surgical physician, and not an expert ) I strongly suspect he was (1) impaired (2) not competent and (3) lacking basic integrity (4) under some kind of financial pressure. 

My lay suspicion for what actually happened, is based on the the absolute impossibility of anyone systematically dissecting a liver while believing it is a spleen, and  absolute impossibility of even a drunk medical student later mistaking an intact liver on a slab for a spleen (came back at least 3 different time and still called it a spleen).

He probably started the dubious laparoscopy with intent to remove the spleen, ran up against this distended colon, and accidentally nicked something vascular, causing blood in his field. Forced to switch to open laparotomy, he shortly ended up cutting the IVC, causing massive bleeding, cardiac arrest, and panic. In his panic, he never even asked for a clamp or suction, according to OR staff, just kept clicking away with his stapler, just tearing things up and making things worse, which makes me wonder about basic competence. 

With patient in cardiac arrest, he proceeds to explore right side of peritoneal cavity instead of left, identify & cut falciform, round, hepatorenal, IvC, ligaments, ligamentum venosum, portal vein, hepatic artery hepatic veins, and common bile duct, pull out this gargantuan 5 pound organ, then declare “I got the spleen! Look, it’s a spleen guys!” Then comes back multiple times and looks at a 5 pound liver that’s shaped exactly like a liver in the textbooks and any medical student would call a liver, and continues to call it a spleen. 

He was desperately trying to come up with a cover narrative that would result in the least punitive consequences for himself (probably started thinking about this when he first went to open laparotomy), but was coming up blank, so he just stuck to his original story, sticking with consistency, like liars often do, even if it is insultingly demonstrably untrue. 

I also I wonder if he was under deep financial pressure of some kind too, because otherwise why would he spend 3 days trying to convince his patient to get a dubious splenectomy, even pressuring him by misrepresenting a minimal drop in Hgb to imply urgency when the guy wanted to get back to a hospital near home? And he scheduled it at a hospital where they don’t even do splenectomies, at 4:00 end of day with minimal staffing, and then showed up an hour late (though obviously, being an hour late is nothing suspicious on its own).

This reminds me of the [karolinska institute](https://upworthyscience.com/a-star-surgeon-left-a-trail-of-dead-patients-and-his-whistleblowers-were-punished/) case where Paolo Macchiarini was mutilating patients with plastic tracheas that he claimed to be stem cell enhanced… even doing operations on people who didn’t need them.

A nurse saved my life ,"I just feel very overwhelmed with gratification so I wanted to post this mostly as a thank you to all nurses. As a background, I’m a 31 y/o female and work in the service industry. I’m used to being exposed to illness, especially during the COVID-19 epidemic. I’m a past smoker (have quit for 3 years at this point), and the whole pandemic made me worried because I felt as a smoker I was more compromised than others. 

I first started feeling sick about a month ago, but it was very mild, cold like symptoms. No problem, I’m a single woman and can take care of myself. Then it became different, I couldn’t swallow, I couldn’t talk, I was very genuinely bed ridden with everything feeling painful.. even moving to go to the restroom felt like a chore. I was very worried I had Covid. So I was specifically looking up how to remedy myself.

I’m a waitress, I don’t have company given health insurance and if I felt like it wasn’t horrible; I could handle it myself. This is that kind of situation. I did what I normally do and tried to take care of myself.

Weeks went by and after very much urgency and care from some friends, I went to the hospital. It was late, like 11 pm. I went to the emergency care room because I really didn’t know where else to go. I couldn’t talk at this point, I typed what I needed to say on my phone. I told them my symptoms and they very clearly saw I wasn’t well. 

To their credit, the doctors on at that time were wanting to run tests on me, like an MRI, and do what they could. Very unfortunately, I started to cry because I knew this would clearly become a very expensive bill and I could not afford it. I refused these services. 

While they contemplate what to do, a very sweet nurse named Melissa was trying to reassure me. I felt like a bad person, like I was prohibiting these people from doing their jobs. It’s morbid but I felt like I didn’t care if I wasn’t able to be diagnosed. She kept telling me “we have so many tools, and we will figure this out.”

She’s getting me set up to stay the night and she notices a scratch on my arm. A very small scratch. She asked what it was from and I explained my cat and I play a little rough sometimes (my cat loves belly rubs but sometimes she decides we’re done very abruptly). She asks more simple questions, like if she’s and outside cat and whatnot (she’s not). 

She leaves and I assume talks to a doctor. The doctor comes in and does a quick swab and leaves. I had literal “cat scratch fever” from my cat’s bad timing to accidentally scratch me after using her litter box before cleaning herself. 

Very simple antibiotics and a stern look to my cat later and we’re all good. Thank you to all nurses that ask these kind of questions. She could’ve very well ignored such a minuscule scratch but she didn’t. She found out that I had a pet and that my symptoms matched up with a simple infection.

Given that I had waited maybe too long and had a fever for about two days (mild) at this point, it could’ve been worse if I had waited. You all are Saints and please never think that what you do isn’t appreciated. 

Thank you Melissa in a southwest Florida hospital. You know who you are if you read this, but I don’t want to accidentally cause problems if I’m too specific.

I’m finding that any time I’m suspicious of a HAPI, I am asked to go through allllll of the charted repositioning and try to find a gap. It’s kind of dumb because of course no one is going to truthfully chart that they didn’t reposition their patient. 

My co-workers get really defensive and almost insulting declaring “not everything on a bony prominence is a PI!!!” or “if there’s no documented pressure factor, how could it be a PI?!?!”. Then they go through some mental & word gymnastics to call the wound anything but a PI (evolved MASD, wound of unknown etiology) when it’s so very obvious that it’s a HAPI. All because of pressure (no pun intended) from leadership to have zero HAPIs.

RE: Question for ED Nurses from an ED Doctor,"Urine samples are so awful for patient throughput. I make a point to not order them just because they are on the order set. Been on the nurse side of that nonsense too many times before being an NP.

When I want urine on an ambulatory patient I give them a urine cup and send them to the bathroom when I do my initial exam. Tell them to go to the bathroom, bring the sample back into this room. The nurse can send it to the lab when they come in to do all the orders I am putting in for the patient. Get it before they are put on a monitor and IV drip, etc.

Otherwise, it's HOURS to get it through no fault of the nurse. This way we don't have to unhook EVERYTHING after the patient finally ""has to pee"" in about two to three hours (and usually RIGHT NOW after a liter of IV fluids.)

Conversely I’ve seen people with bullet wounds, open fractures, etc say they have a 4/10. It’s worthless. 

When they get re evaluated, you just ask if what you did before was enough, if not then escalate your regimen, repeat until symptom relief. It’s also important to set expectations early. I tell all my patients the goal is not the absence of pain, just to get it to a tolerable level while the underlying issue heals. People tend to be fairly understanding when you frame it for them. 

Also truthfully I’m just not here to be the gatekeeper of pain meds. I’m a judicious prescriber, but single doses/short courses don’t significantly lead to addiction issues.

Patients always super grateful. Like by the time you give the 4/10 pain med and it kicks in, they say it's up to a 7 or 8 by the time it takes it to work, so you're better off giving the 7/10 pain med anyway.

I have had to stand outside of a patients room waiting and watching as a mom and dad were hugging their 3 year old and sobbing because we were putting in one more ecmo cannula (when he already had 3- his cardiac anatomy and flows were weird because of a glenn operation with extra things) as a last ditch effort even though prior to this we all talked as a surgery team in private and knew the patient wouldn’t make it. I put that kid of ecmo 2 days before this and then he died 3 days later on my shift. Seeing those parents cry over their baby that they knew was dying while I was pregnant with my second and had a 1 year old at home was so incredibly difficult.

All of that’s to say that I guarantee you that if anyone had to be those parents watching their little human that they created be taken away and couldn’t control it they would be a little bit more respectful to those who took care of their kiddo. Because they understand that we truly try our best to ensure that proper care is being met for everyone. And sometimes we might not be able to focus on their kiddo at that time because they are stable. Because they are safe. And sometimes that results in a diaper rash or a crying baby that’s hungry. And while I understand those parents can be upset- they need to take a step back and be grateful that they do not have to be the parents that are woken up and rushed out of their kids room at 3am because we are cracking their chest (this is a true story)",1727675996.0

RE: Case Management Job Search,"Revamp your resume! One of the top pieces of advice I got was that my resume was too ""nursey"" and made it look like I was seeking another clinical position, when in fact I wanted to go into something nonclinical. Having a HR person review my resume was the best thing I could have done.

Look at a job description for the type of position you would like. Identify key words of what they are looking for. Figure out how to describe the skills you've gained in your clinical positions using words from the job description.

I started my resume with a Skills/Qualifications section where I added some key words from the job description, where applicable.

I slimmed down the wordiness of the work experience section, and included more keywords. Example: I was applying for a research nurse position; in the position I was leaving, I had experience collaborating with CRCs and CNRCs, with caring for clinical trial patients, and with reading clinical trial materials, so I included those skills into the job description. 

Later I found a Utilization Management position I was really interested in. Tailored the resume, got hired. With the experience you have, I am certain you can transition into Case Management.  Just gotta get that resume past the AI screening tools with keywords!

RE: Is it inappropriate to shave a comatose patient?,"I was in a trauma ICU as a patient at 17 years old from a nearly fatal MVA. I wasn’t comatose, but my consciousness was a bit touch and go for the first week. The first few rounds of nurses I had behaved as if they were scared to do anything for me besides medicate me. My hair was soaked in dried blood, my mouth was bloody from injuries, both of my legs were hooked to wound vacs and stapled and stitched from top to bottom with dried blood around them. I felt disgusting and helpless because I couldn’t do anything about it. But there was one nurse on day shift, who came in with a whole basin full of supplies to bathe me without me asking. The mouth swabs (I couldn’t open my mouth enough to brush my teeth), a razor to shave my armpits, waterless shampoo, the whole works. All that to say, she shaved my armpits for me because I couldn’t, washed my hair and even braided it because I couldn’t, and helped me with the little bit I could do. And I will never forget her, she was the first nurse that made me feel human in the most traumatic time of my life. From a patient and nurse standpoint, I don’t think it’s inappropriate to do grooming and hygiene for those that can’t, but like others have said asking next of kin is best course of action.

ETA- Thank you so much for all the upvotes, this is still a hard story to tell at times.

Unfortunately, this crates a situation worse than actual lack of a warning - people become complicit and just click through without reading.

Yes they can be. However the incidence rate and severity is far lower than withdrawing from opioids. And tapering SSRI/SNRIs is far easier than tapering opioids for the vast majority of patients.

The global risk of SSRI/SNRI withdrawal is lower than opioid withdrawal. That doesn't mean the SSRI/SNRI withdrawal risk is *zero.* But it does mean that when talking about dependency, the two groups should not be considered medically equal (which is the point i was responding to).

> Signed a patient who was treated like a drug seeker for needing a venlafaxine script and met with incredulity that there would be any physical withdrawal symptoms.

Sorry to hear that. Personally I don't understand why anyone stops psychiatric or mood-altering meds without some kind of taper. The brain is remarkably plastic and you can't take meds like ssri/snri without some form of response on the part of the brain itself. Remove the meds, and the brain has to readjust. Tapering is a zero risk intervention, so i just do it for everyone.

>As a family medicine/gp it's a bit of a worry you don't recognize this.

RE: Question for ED Nurses from an ED Doctor,"I love that you’re asking this! The first thing that comes to mind: Understand that ED nurses have more than one patient & we have to prioritize care based on acuity, especially in the nursing shortage we’re in. ED providers can be myopic & overly focused only on the patient in front of them rather than the department as a whole. You might be tempted to hustle along aspects of care to get to dispo on specific patients for your own convenience. E.g. bugging the nurse to get a urine sample on a stable patient so you can discharge them when the nurse is busy getting a work-up started on a sicker patient you aren’t the provider for, etc. I’ve had so many ED providers do this because they want to go home & don’t want to give handoff to another doc, etc. and it’s frustrating, especially if it’s just a checking the box thing & they’ve already made dispo decision. We have to juggle care for many patients and may have different priorities than you based on sick vs not sick. We will get to all the tasks, but have to allocate resources toward patients who need them most - and our time/attention are resources. If you have to expedite care, please consider your requests in the best interests of the patient & be understanding.

I make 110k in base salary with bonuses on production which amounts to about 5k per year. I get 200 hours of PTO (including CME),  and 1500 in CME expenses.  This coming year they are going to provide a 401k with 3% match.  They pay for malpractice and for my license, and certification expenses, etc.  No health insurance.  My question is what does this compare to anyone else in middle Tennessee region, we are not Nashville, so I am not looking for big city pay.  I know that TN does not pay the greatest, but I am looking for a 3% annual standard cost of living raise, and am told they can't afford to do that. I bring in at least 350k to the office in revenue.  I would appreciate any feedback or thoughts on the salary and the ask for the 3% annual.  Thanks again",1727475291.0

RE: Why is underdosage of anesthesia and pain management so common?,"I know my daughter has, until this last admission, always been under treated. She’s only 3, which I think is some of the reason. 

All surgeries have only been treated with acetaminophen and ibuprofen. She had her trach stoma dilated and new trach replaced (blood everywhere, only 2 month old trach, so pretty new stoma) in the ER with nothing and multiple adults holding her down. IV placements with ultrasound would take hours with nothing given to help calm her down (she has almost no access at all). 
She had a recent admission where they finally started treating her like a real person and it was a night and day difference. She was given morphine PRN after broviac placement, given versed for an IV placements, heavily sedated for PICC line attempt (2.5 hours in IR, couldnt get a PICC - so literally, no access left in her). 

It’s not much better from what I’ve seen on the adult side when the patient wasn’t able to advocate for themselves. I’ve had to fight with providers to pre medicate prior to intense wound care, or first trach change on an anxious patient.

1. Stick up for us, patients and management.

2. When we ask a question about an order, instead of berating us for why we're questioning you, turn it into a teaching moment. It'll help us provide better care in the long run, and help us anticipate orders in the future. 

3. Accept that patients will tell the nurse a whole story, then when the doctor comes in will add 5 other serious details to the same story. Like ' oh they're just here for toe pain! ' then the patient says ' oh I was bit by a rattlesnake an hour ago on that toe. ' (this is sarcasm, but they will be there for toe pain then turn around and say chest pain when the doctor comes in)

4. Remember we're humans too with complex lives outside the hospital. 

5. If we say, hey somethings not right, come assess the patient. We might not be able to tell you what is wrong, bit we're good on picking up on subtle patient changes because we're at the bedside more minutes than you get with the patients.

Being a new grad anywhere is going to be extremely tough especially the first year, but you should start to feel less overwhelmed and a general grasp after a year, not exactly comfortable tho (depending on specialty ) but more manageable.

RE: Question for ED Nurses from an ED Doctor,"Please explain your plan to patients when you can, we understand when things evolve but I've worked with a lot of doctors who go do their assessment and then just leave and I'm stuck scrambling when I go in the room next and the patient wants to know why they're getting a CT scan

Please learn where basic stuff in the unit is. The amount of time and hassle that's saved from you knowing where a urine cup and handing it to them because it's literally in the room is vs telling the patient you want a sample and then coming to find me to tell me to bring them a urine cup, or a piece of gauze, or other stuff that's literally right next to you but you have to come find me to get it, we both could've been saved a good ten minutes of futile interaction. 

Please feel free to tell me what your plan is. Even if it's a basic workup. I'm more than happy to know what you're thinking. It helps me and helps the patient. And definitely if you're doing something that's maybe a little more or less than might be typical for the presentation. It helps all of us to be on the same page.

If your unit has access to stuff like epic messages or similar and your nurses use them, please use them and check them. It's so much easier to shoot you a message you can answer at your convenience for nonurgent stuff than to try to hunt you down to ask or remember to the next time I see you. 

This might be niche but try to pay attention to unit limitations. My unit often has an issue with no transporters no techs and backed up CT on nights. I have a doc that regularly throws tantrums at the charge nurse and leaves all caps comments on the track board about why a patient hasn't been to CT yet and it's because we literally have no one to take them there and CT is still two code strokes deep.

Pilonidal cysts are like my worst fear I couldn’t imagine having such a callous response to that.

My cousin had gotten a nail in his foot and the nurse just started, without any warning, digging into his foot and giving no anesthesia as she started cutting into it. Eventually my aunt demanded she stop and then she got the help of a different nurse who gave him the anesthesia (he was 11 years old when this was happening)

Or like how during cervical biopsies it’s so common to give women absolutely nothing for the pain? That’s insane, if someone took a chunk out of my penis I would want them to numb it.

RE: Feeling some sort of way that the city got an “evacuate immediately” order and we all had to stay at the hospital ,"In NOLA, and I believe many other costal areas in the gulf, this is our protocol for hurricanes:
Once a year, or whenever your hospital allows, you sign up for one of 2 or 3 teams. I’ve heard of some hospitals that have an A, B, and C team. I don’t really know what a C team is, as no hospital I’ve ever worked in had one. 

You pick your team. No one forces your hand. I’ve never had even experienced or seen peer pressure or guilt from mangers during this process. I’ve never been in a situation where we didn’t have enough people volunteer for the A team.

You place your name, and any other information they need depending on your answer. When I choose to be on the A team, I had to fill out my emergency contact, blood type, weight, and height. (Weight for helicopter evac reasons, or so I’m told)

A team rides the hurricane out. They stay at the hospital when they are notified to be there by and all the way up until the B team comes to relieve them. 
You bring your own clothes and snacks but the hospital generally provides food for you, 3 meals a day. You are paid 24/7 the entire time you are there. You only work 12 hour shifts and stay in empty patient rooms/hang out off 12 hours- but are still paid. And usually it’s time and a half pay for those hours. 
If you can bring children, spouses, or pets is up to the hospital. To my knowledge, no hospital in NOLA currently allows pets- but some allow any dependents you have come stay with you as well. 

The experience of staying during a hurricane is not as scary as it seems, and is actually quite boring (barring the Katrina exception). Hospitals have big boss generators so electricity never goes out and will spend the coming days shipping out as many patients as possible before the hurricane hits. A team can be there for 2 or 3 days usually (sometimes even a day). 

B team is meant to come back as soon as the hospital notifies them to- usually when the national guard/government gives the all clear for people to re-enter the city. B team does not stay 24 hours, they are expected to go home after their 12 hour shift, but hospitals usually provide either hotels nearby or empty patient rooms for any staff who need a place to stay (due to lack of electricity or home damage).

A team, I believe, is usually supposed to have a full 24 hours off before having to report for their next shift. 

There are certain exceptions that can excuse you from both teams- this is usually pregnancy or military service, but your manager can usually give you an exception on a case by case basis.",1727674064.0

This also doesn't explain the huge discrepancy in cost between nations. Olympic costs $50 to $100 a month in Europe and $1,000 or more per month in the US...

Now it's possible that they are dumping (selling below cost) in Europe and subsidizing with American sales. But even then, American consumers are paying more than the cost plus profit to subsidize other nations.

I’m a new nurse and am being bullied & ready to leave my job.,"Hello! I just need to vent somewhere because my job is putting me in a bad head space. I am in my early 20’s & graduated nursing school last year. The issue is with a coworker. I used to get along with this person fine but since they have taken over a leadership role, I feel like I am being targeted. Everything I do is criticized, nothing I do is right, and am getting scolded like a child in front of my coworkers. They are like mid 40’s mind you. I know there is still so much I don’t know, and I have never acted like I know everything, but every time they talk to me it’s to make me feel like I’m stupid or tell me how something “should” be done (majority of this advice is unsolicited & given in a very passive aggressive manner). This person is also lazy, they never help others unless it was their one buddy they have. Their side of the department is not busy and hardly ever has patients, while my side of the department is drowning, yet they still get paid 40 hours a week to sit & play games while everyone else runs their head off. One example of this is I had a really horrible shift, and I had just gotten a patient back to recover from a surgery. They (without me even asking) come into my room and start criticizing how I am not assessing the patient and being thorough enough (I truly was) & makes a fuss at me for there being one drop of blood on the patient’s table from a blood draw (I was actively also getting ready to clean it). Well something else happened and I had to run out really quick. As I was doing this, my other patient had an accident & while I was gone my other coworkers were really kind & cleaned them up. Mind you this whole day my coworker did nothing but jack around. Anyway, when I get back this coworker absolutely rips into me, telling me I was leaving my coworkers on purpose (I wasn’t) & that it “leaves a bad taste in others mouth’s when you abandon your patient”. I shortly after went in the breakroom and cried for a few minutes. The worst thing about that night was I ended up getting a UTI from not being able to go the bathroom all day from how busy it was.

"RE: NPs sue NY for not being paid the same as physicians, stating it is due to ""gender discrimination"". Thoughts?","No, not anywhere near. This isn't to disrespect NPs, but the education/training is unfathomably lower than MD/DOs. An NP is an RN who took a 1-year online self-paced course to get their NP. The course covers very superficial pathophysio, and is composed of a ton of fluff like ""leadership"" and ""nursing theory""  courses, aka, nothing clinically relevant to treat anyone. Once they finish, they don't do a residency and fellowship like MD/DOs. They go straight into the field. It's terrifying and dangerous to patients if they practice without physician oversight.

MD/DOs take 4 years of undergrad, then the MCAT, 4 years of medical school, 3-9 years of residency, 2-3 years of fellowship. MD/DOs take USMLE Step 1 in medical school, Step 2 before graduating medical school, and Step 3 in training. Each exam is roughly 8-10hours. In addition, MD/DOs participate in extensive research throughout their training in order to further increase their expertise in their respective fields. After all this, then an MD/DO can practice.

--Student chant regularly heard during our time in OMT (osteopathic manipulative therapy) lab, especially during craniosacral training, adapted from  the original Star Trek ([S3E4](https://youtu.be/onntXB7qRts?si=KRk1Qj0XdCAIGcJO)), with our apologies to the series. 

Most DOs don't use OMT in practice. At all. A study published in 2021 put the number who don't use it at around 60%. And around 20% more don't use it for 95% to 99% of patients. Fewer than 4% use it for more than 75% of their patients. And this was an email survey, so I'll eat my hat if it's not skewed positively toward OMT since there is a small subset of DOs who are OMT fanatics and it's probable they were more likely to respond that others.  

From personal knowledge, I can tell you that what of OMT that is practiced, it is mostly performed by general/family practitioners.  And, anecdotally, I'd say 90%-plus of the time it's done more as performative art, for it's placebic value, than for anything else. It's a kind of an added value ""Why not?"" attitude rather than any strong belief that it's doing something clinically significant to the patient's actual pathology.   

That said, patients *do* like it and it does feel good in the moment. For all the fun most of us made of OMT (there were a handful of ardent acolytes of the art who took it *very* seriously), pretty much everyone enjoyed the lectures, because they were a cognitive break, and especially lab because, again, it does feel good. But almost no one took much of OMT very seriously and certainly not the weirder claims made by some of the professors who taught it. Most viewed it as being potentially an occasionally marginally useful adjunct to ""real medicine"" for a limited number of musculoskeletal problems and even less certainly as an even more marginal adjunct for a limited number of other problems (say, rib raising in patients with pneumonia, although its efficacy being greater than or even equal to standard manual respiratory therapy methods is dubious). 

This would seem to be the reason why ""MDs and DOs...seem to be doing fine together"". DOs, by and large, practice medicine just like MDs  and MDs, by and large, practice medicine just like DOs.

No expert, and I’m sure you and many others know more than I.

I’m sure it wasn’t premeditated murder. But you could argue that some of his actions were reckless disregard for life and manslaughter. Operating impaired, not calling for help… I don’t think surgically dissecting a liver while believing it’s a spleen can be “incompetence”. Because it requires a lot of applied knowledge to cut multiple liver ligaments, portal vein, hepatic arteries and veins, bile duct… you can’t not know that you’re removing a liver. Maybe he accidentally cut the hepatic artery initially (the pulsating thing he claimed was an aneurysm) and in his drunken state, decided the best way to “cover up” his mistake was to complete the hepatectomy? 

There’s no logic to it, but it sure feels like incompetence PLUS an insultingly ham handed attempt to cover up his mistakes, based on panic or drunk logic. He knew damn well it was a liver when he kept coming back to call it a spleen.",1727615422.0
new grad ER job - low salary but good benefits & training?,"Hello all,

I have been searching for jobs for a little over a month now in the Metro Detroit area of Michigan. I have been really trying to get into hospital systems (and non for profit) that will allow me to do PSLF. My main interests are cardiology, emergency med, and internal med, and possibly primary care.

I have this really great physician group that works for local hospitals that just offered me an ER job that would be close to home....**however base pay is only 95K** (for 14 shifts per month). Any shifts over 14 per month is 70$ per hour, but from reading it seems like doing more than that will lead to quicker burnout. They are known to have a really good training program and I have rotated with the group during clinical rotations and the docs and APPs were all awesome, friendly, supportive.

Some info on benefits... no PTO, no holiday pay, no PSLF, have to work every other weekend and half of the major holidays. 401K/Profit Sharing 5%. Cash pension – 2% Eligible after one year & 1000 hours of service. 3000$ CME, health insurance, malpractice, pays for licensing, and an annual bonus which is eligible after 1 year of service.

I am considering this job even with the LOW salary bc I would like ER experience to use to get into cardiology in the future, good training program, I want to start working asap!!, its a hospital setting and close to home, well known for supportive providers and training. *BUT, is the salary just too low to even consider regardless of the pros?? Should I just stay unemployed for months after graduation continuing to try to get into a hospital facility??*

RE: Does Wernicke encefalopathy arise because of alcohol withdrawal or is it just most frequently seen in these patients?,"Specifically arising during EtOH withdrawal is probably coincidence as it's more common in alcohol use disorder generally: alcohol-based diets tend to be very low in thiamine, and alcohol may disrupt absorption of thiamine.  So patients who display Wernicke encephalopathy in a state of alcohol withdrawal were probably going in that direction anyway.

I haven't thought about WE specifically in an EtOH withdrawal setting before, so I can only offer some educated speculation otherwise, but some possible ideas:

* They may not actually have the full Wernicke picture but are classified as such because they are in alcohol withdrawal delirium (i.e., encephalopathy) and clinical anchoring bias takes over (i.e., an encephalopathic alcoholic must be Wernicke encephalopathy)
* Alcohol withdrawal is a hyperactivated state which may place higher energy demands on the body and ""reveal"" the deficit of thiamine when cellular respiration is too slow to keep up with the energy demand.
* Alcohol withdrawal is more ""obvious"" and more likely to land you in a hospital, where clinicians will identify Wernicke encephalopathy incidentally.",1727358639.0

"RE: So are there just hoards of doctors just telling every patient their symptoms are all in their heads, or they're faking, or having period pains? ","Let me ask you this: Were you still taught that Black women need fewer pain killers? Or has the curriculum been revised?

The problems I see with medical training that hinder analyzing things like gender bias include hierarchy and bullying—you’re not supposed to question higher-ups but shut up and do what you’re told; sleep deprivation—it’s been shown to impair empathy and emotional intelligence; inhumane work schedules enhanced by stimulant use—impair critical thinking and attract adrenaline junkies with superiority complexes; and rote memorization rather than analysis, which includes not challenging what’s in the textbook. 

From the point of view of my field (and probably sociology and public health as well), you could diagnose medical training itself as “unhealthy” and “toxic” and “in need of medicine.” It is very difficult to challenge bias in situations where people don’t have or take the time to discuss the topic and do self-analysis. In fact, students who go in without biases sometimes come out with them—this includes female students, Native American students, etc. 

Physicians and other healthcare providers who are interested in challenging dogma, however, generally grit their teeth, hold their noses, and get through school, THEN incorporate more humane, ethical, and justice-orientated models in their own practices. I don’t have a good answer for this. In a fantasy world run by science and public health instead of by MBAs, I could envision curricular changes, union-like work protections for trainees, government scholarships to med school for rural medicine or that focused on restorative justice.

I agree with everybody else that it's a polite thing to do but it's good to assess patient history (for religious values that dictate growing a beard) and to ask visitors before going ahead with it, provided these things are available. ",1727653182.0
RE: Does Wernicke encefalopathy arise because of alcohol withdrawal or is it just most frequently seen in these patients?,"I think the medicolegal risk is a fair concern. Personally, it doesn’t factor into the equation. The hypoglycemic drunk in front of me is more likely to decompensate from delays in treatment of hypoglycemia than they or their family are to sue me for the theoretical risk of glucose before thiamine. It’s also a low probability that they would succeed in that suit, given the emergent condition always takes precedence over theoretical risks in emergency care (although obviously in a suit, anything can happen depending on jury selection).

point 1 is uncommon, because confabulating patients are hard to discharge and wernicke's does not go away before discharge. prolonged withdrawal delirium is (usually) easy to separate

I also think a lot of it is subtle and many make doctors would be shocked if you noted it.  Health care has objectively made major efforts to address race, ethnicity, sexual orientation etc and there has been a lot of effort to discuss implicit bias to help well intentioned people learn.

RE: New grad oncology salary negotiations,"(PA for ~decade here)… Pre-PA patient care experience and rotations during school are very unlikely to be effective bargaining chips— nothing demonstrates work competency other than actual work experience. Student rotations are not remotely the same as being on the job.  Remember salary is based on productivity and reimbursements (RVUs), and as a new grad you’ll likely be unable to bring in enough to the practice to cover your salary at first (you’ll be a net negative for a while in terms of $ until you’re able to safely increase patient load).  

 The best (only) bargaining chip for a higher salary would be the lack of PSLF —- that is a HUGE negative and would personally recommend reconsidering based on that depending on how much loans you have. The loans are a massive pain and (as someone in the last year of PSLF) —it is a godsend. You can still be in onc and get PSLF- consider academic medical centers etc  

 If you’re set on this job, consider negotiating for a bonus structure based on productivity (instead of just asking for more $ in salary)- that’ll likely be MUCH more palatable to the practice since they’ll only be dishing out extra money if you’re truly earning it, plus it incentivizes you to be productive, which is a win-win ",1727552677.0

Additionally the benefits and security are a worthwhile trade off IMO. I would not incur any additional educational debt unless you have a next step in your career pivot solidified.

Looking for a discussion or advice in what you would have done in this situation. I work in a procedural area and we unfortunately had a patient pass on our table. This was end of day and everyone stayed to help the call team code the patient and deal with the paperwork/ post mortem care. However, this patient had a daughter that was driving in from around an hour away. The nursing supervisor wanted the patients body to stay in our pre/post recovery area while waiting on family. Mind you this is after working hours and this unit is not staffed at this time. The call team was also refusing to stay with the patient and said the patient could stay in a pre-op room until family arrived. I spoke up and said that it was unacceptable to leave a dead patient in an unsecured area alone. The nursing supervisor was also okay with this plan. Am I the only one that thinks this is horrible patient care and also unsafe? How awful it would have been for the family to walk into a room with no one around and you have no idea who could walk in that room at any time completely unsupervised. Can I get some feedback on this? Does anyone have a policy for what to do in this situation? 

Follow up: the patient went to the morgue and I’m not sure that the daughter was ever able to the view the body..just the other family that was present. 😔",1727638934.0

RE: Pitt to offer “Doctor of Chiropractic” program. Where is this mystic pseudoscientific field headed?,">I am sure not every DO embraced that change, but when your profession did reach its hand out, it was taken. 

I guess that's one way of putting it. Another is the actual history.

Osteopathic medicine was founded by a traditionally trained MD (Andrew Taylor Still) near the end of the 19th century. He recognized that medicine in his time was profoundly unscientific and a hodgepodge of treatments based on anecdotes and traditions, many of which were outright harmful. His theories about subluxations and disease and the founding of his medical model on musculoskeletal manipulation as an efficacious modality wasn't any more scientific, but at least the treatments were mostly benign. 

There was no philosophical antagonism toward treatment by drugs and surgery, though. In fact, selective surgical treatments were already incorporated in the curriculum of the first osteopathic medical school in the 1890's. Dr. Still just considered much of what was available to be not well evidenced as having significant efficacy and, in fact, they appeared to him to do more harm than good. He was not entirely wrong about this. 

After the turn of the century, medicine started to become more scientifically grounded, particularly in regard to drug therapy.  With that, the osteopathic profession began to adopt treatments that had some reasonable evidence of being safe and effective. By the 30's, the AOA required osteopathic medical schools to teach pharmacology and integrate drug use into their clinical curriculum. By and large,  DO's were fully on board with adopting treatments for which there was good evidence even though there was still a strong emphasis on the benefits of OMT which was practiced by virtually every DO. 

As the first half of the 1900's was coming to an end, DO's came to believe that they were as fully trained as MDs to practice the full scope of medicine and many were even lobbying to convert their degree to a more recognized ""MD"". In the 60's, California offered them that option and almost 90% of DOs licensed by the state took advantage of that to make their dream come true. Like a jinn granting a wish, though, this backfired spectacularly on many since these new ""MDs"" were not accepted  by MD institutions, and what DOs were left in the state considered them turncoats. No other such degree swapping has been offered anywhere since.

""Separate but equal"" was the professional stance of the AOA (still is). Unfortunately, DOs were at a decided disadvantage when it came to clinical training, particularly specialty training. MDs would not allow them to practice in their facilities and osteopathic facilities were relatively few in number. And what few there were had scant specialists to train up and coming physicians. So DOs were almost entirely ""general practitioners"" who were well educated in that regard but did not have much exposure to specialty care. Still, they were reasonably competent in their role as primary care physicians.

So, primary care training for DOs has been on par with MDs for quite some time. Meanwhile, the osteopathic profession was able to increase its training infrastructure (for example, I trained at an ""osteopathic hospital"" with over 500 beds with all major specialties represented). Despite that, it's still true that osteopathic-centric hospitals are still on the average smaller and have fewer subspeciality procedures and training opportunities than MD-heavy institutions. But the gradual increase in admittance of DOs into many MD specialty training programs made the 
 sparsity of such programs at osteopathic institutions relatively irrelevant. And as of 2020, DO and MD training programs merged, further reducing this as a problem for DOs. (Although many state licensing boards still will not accept ACGME-only CME for license renewal. You *must* have a certain number of ""AOA"" credits. A portrait of protectionism.)

Division between MDs and DOs has devolved into an almost entirely political one that exists almost entirely at the organizational level. The AOA tenaciously hangs onto it's separate identity and independent certification and regulatory power with a death grip, but DOs by and large don't have any cultish devotion to their osteopathic medical degree. And MDs, who gradually came to work side by side more and more often with DOs, gradually came to mostly acknowledge that DO training is for the most part on par with their own (and not infrequently completed at MD institutions). 

>Even though some did not support it or hampered its decades-long process of change.

The AOA has played self-protectionist political games that have sometimes been an impediment, but most DOs have been on board with integrating with MDs since at least the mid-20th century.",1727209334.0

RE: 'I Don’t Want to Die.' He needed mental health care. He found a ghost network,"Training of any professional is fundamentally bottlenecked by the availability of supervising and educating professionals. You can't snap your fingers and make these come out of thin air. You can point to whatever factors in history you want, the outcome was that we are currently severely undersupplied with regard to psych professionals vs social demand. The payment models in Healthcare are also not based on any free market OR central control designed for the ""greater good."" 



Payment in US Healthcare seems to be controlled (at least) by insurers looking to profit maximally by being the middleman, a cartel of proceduralist medical specialities, and politicians seeking electoral leverage. These trends have been active for nearly a century. These trends divert talented and intelligent people to practices outside of mental health. It was up until 2015 or so that psychiatry was considered a joke of a specialty for the most stupid and lazy medical students. Yes, there will always be a few passionate and incredible clinicians, researchers, academics. But, the general desire to enter the profession has been commensurate with the pay. 



Under these conditions, how can you sustain a training program that has any quality? The hospital system looks at their books: the psychiatry services are a net negative if you examine their books alone. How can it be otherwise when the best reimbursement is for procedures? Pay for supervisors and educators in psychiatry is thus rock button low. Hospitals disband their mental health services. Clinicians leave for private practice where they can get cash pay. 


On the other hand, with psychotherapy, the opposite problem occurred. It cost nearly nothing to run a mental health master's or doctoral program, and there were endless easy student loan dollars to be harvested. 




With rapid expansion of training programs, a cargo cult will always emerge. In psychotherapy, studies of short term therapy modalities conducted on simple patients by world class experts in the treatment arm compare outcomes to no or sham treatments. Society begins to believe that psychotherapy is a treatment of didactics: merely delivering information and teaching behaviors. The ability to understand and accurately identify psychopathology further degrades. 



The government continually expands licensure in mental health treatment to address clinician shortages. This is of course cheaper than paying the clinicians. The market becomes flooded with new graduates who are not ""trained"" so much as led, blind, by the blind, or hardly led at all. 



The government and large payors then look at their outcomes. It appears there are no clear outcomes differences between highly trained and totally untrained clinicians. Or, at least none worth paying for. Anyone (legally authorized) can listen to a patient rant and vent for an hour, and anyone can read advice and exercises from a textbook. Anyone can pick a chapter of the DSM that the patient resembles and prescribe an FDA approved medication. After all, this is what the worst and the bulk of mental health professionals often do. 





Outside of true believers and maybe 40 or so academic institutions (a drop in face of the huge demand and supply for clinicians), the good and great clinicians have passed away, retired, or have moved towards accepting cash only. The shortage is so great that even a mediocre practitioner can run a cash practice. Outside of great masochism and charity, why else would one do such difficult work for so little pay? Why navigate a complex insurance system and fill out paperwork and still risk having your payments clawed back?



So here we are today: insurance pay is still not equal to other specialty medical treatment for psychiatry. Therapists and psychologists (rightly or wrongly) are reimbursed less per hour by payors (not patients) than they probably ever have been. What will we do? Pay more for poorly trained clinicians already in the field? Fund training programs to be led by the blindly trained?
 



What's the solution? There is no clear solution, or we need at least ten separate ones to start. I would personally start by expanding systems of telehealth for access and *triaging* public dollars into the most serious conditions. I would educate the public before we educate clinicians, so they may understand what is and what is not *treatment*. We will not be able to agree, as a society, as what is more or less serious until it is too late. It is always too late.",1727019676.0

As with everything insurance there are strict rules.

If the doc has never or almost never has seen the patient (on their own sched), you're likely to have insurance take issue in an audit. Ie fraud claims.

I did one rotation at a practice that did this. The doc saw every patient for initial eval and also saw each patient 1/4 office visits. 

If the doc is just in the building it doesn't mean they can never see a patient yet bill incident to (for higher reimbursement) forevermore",1727444188.0

RE: Pitt to offer “Doctor of Chiropractic” program. Where is this mystic pseudoscientific field headed?,"> Ya, except DOs are also fully trained doctors.

So will these chiropractors. Just like the PharmDs and the DPTs and the JDs and PhDs. They won't be physicians, but the majority of people who have the title doctor aren't, either.

> That's in contrast to a chiropractor who would likely do an x ray, interpret it with minimal training and no radiologist, and treat it with manipulation. Like... If you walked into a chiropractor with a spinal epidural abscess, how many of them would say ""hmm... History of IVDU and a fever? Go to the ED"" Vs ""hmmm. Take some Tylenol and let's get cracking.""

You are presuming to know the teaching and curriculum of this program. All chiropractors are not trained the same. I've chiropractors refer medical issues to me in lieu of cracking.

Will this program just be a cash grab, like many of the chiropractor schools? Maybe. Will it be a higher standard? We don't know. But it's certainly a possibility, since a major research university is conferring a professional doctorate degree.

I may have made point in a non-sensical and obtuse way. But...let's say that this program does a year of basic science, a year of general pathology, then two years of clinical rotations focused on techniques they have in common with OMT...well, that kind of looks the curriculum of a lot of professional health doctorates, with a similar grounding in evdience-based-ish diagnosis and treatment.",1727144244.0

"RE: So are there just hoards of doctors just telling every patient their symptoms are all in their heads, or they're faking, or having period pains? ","I see tons of miscommunication in healthcare every day, and tons of patients misunderstanding what they were actually told and then mis-quoting their doctor later on. For example, outpatient doctors, how often have you seen a patient for an ER follow up visit and they said ""The ER doc didn't do anything for me!"" but you read the ER note and see the blood work and imaging that was done, the IV medications given, the specialty referral placed, the medications the patient was prescribed upon discharge. I think some people just have a very skewed view of the definition of ""the doctor didn't do anything!"" or ""they told me nothing was wrong"".

Now, as many other commenters have said, there are also definitely some bad doctors out there who for whatever reason actually don't care about their patients (burnout, or just being not a great person to begin with). But i think that is not as common as many people believe. I'm Family Medicine, so i often see patients complaining of symptoms from numerous organ systems. It can take multiple visits and multiple tests to figure out whether symptom X is caused by the same disease that is causing symptom Y vs a totally separate issue. And sometimes i never get it figured out, and refer to a specialist who also can't give a good explanation for the patient's symptoms. It is common for a patient's condition to not be accurately diagnosed even after more than one visit for the complaint. It is also quite common for the patient to come to the conclusion that the first doctor they saw is incompetent because they haven't figured it out yet, then go to a second doctor (who has the benefit of knowing the results of the evaluation done by doctor #1); if doctor #2 gets the diagnosis right, then doctor #2 is, in the mind of the patient, more competent than doctor #1.

I had a patient once who came in for a same day visit complaining of chest pain, dizziness, diaphoresis, and peripheral edema. Had severely elevated BP. I sent the pt to the ER due to cardiac concerns. Negative workup for acute cardiac syndrome, started on antihypertensives and referred for outpatient Cardiology evaluation for possible CHF. At some later point, patient sees a Gynecologist who says the peripheral edema (which persisted after the other symptoms improved) might be a symptom of menopause. So, get this, the patient sends me angry web messages about not wanting me to be her doctor anymore because i was stupid enough to think her edema was heart related and i must not know anything about menopause, so i should go back to medical school. She accused me of telling her that her symptoms were ""all in her head"" though i never said anything of the sort. I guarantee you that she has told many other people that i am a bad doctor because i did not diagnose her correctly or care about her and i ""brushed her off"". Like i said before, it is probably true that some doctors really do ignore patients or ""brush them off"", but i know for an absolute fact that at least some of the time the patients are just lying when they say that, or are at best severely misinterpreting the reality of the situation.",1727289792.0

There wasn’t enough information in the post as to when wound care was called. But I can say from my first and his diaper rashes he had, if he was in the hospital and had those rashes they would’ve called wound care. But there’s nothing that anyone could’ve done to prevent those rashes. We found he was SUPER sensitive to augmentin to the point that his butt would be bleeding within minutes of that poop touching his skin. We would have to pin him down and wipe as he was screaming in pain. I told our pediatrician to never ever give him augmentin again and we listed it as an allergy. And his rash occurred within 10 minutes of his poop. So it’s entirely possible that her baby could’ve had a similar reaction that quickly but no one knew that they would’ve had the reaction until they did. So there’s just not enough details to say for certain that neglect was happening just because wound care was called.

I felt the same way when I first started emergency med. I stuck it out for 3 years and I’m grateful I did. I switched to a different specialty where I cover inpatient and clinic, and wow.

Most patients with comorbidities will have HTN, DM, CKD, HLD, CHF, COPD , a fib, pacemaker history, etc etc, etc  . You’ll do much better managing their care having a solid background in that.

For practice building, I basically figured out (coming from inpatient positions) don't try to turf a bunch of stuff out or manage it over the phone. Most patients actually prefer to follow with you to review scan results, endoscopy results, see if a treatment is working, etc. I am fine managing stuff over the phone if patients ask, but my default is that if my RN cannot manage it over the phone and patient is okay coming in, bring them in.

Second, I really did not want to follow stable patients that PCP could manage at first, I felt it was not a good use of their or my time. But actually a lot of patients want to follow annually even to just refill 1-2 meds or be told everything is fine. So I went from telling them to see me PRN to offering to follow them annually if they wanted, and most do want that.

Next thing is just to be patient. Enjoy this time now as much as you can, even though sitting around doing jack shit is often torturous, chances are in a year you will look back at this post and miss that free time.

RE: 'I Don’t Want to Die.' He needed mental health care. He found a ghost network,"Sad story. It sucks trying to find a provider for anything even as a physician, the insurance provider database websites suck and I can't imagine how much worse it would be if one were intoxicated and/or in the midst of a depressive episode. 

It's hard to say what percentage of the blame lies with the insurance provider here vs the many other factors at play including the lack of anything approaching a standardized provider database, help from social work getting him connected to care before discharge, decisions to move cities leaving behind an established provider in an effort to outrun alcohol addiction.

It's not a trivial problem to figure out which providers are still practicing and taking on new patients. Perhaps expecting each insurance company to figure this out (and each provider to communicate to each contracted insurer) is a mistake.",1727019162.0

Surgeons….,"I have a question for the masses and not sure if it really is this way or just me being hyper-observant or my environment.

I have been a PA for more than 10 years and worked in Family Medicine, ER, and UCC; currently in Ortho Surgery.

Are ortho surgeon’s decisions based completely on how they feel that day?  Like there is no consistency in their decisions?

For example: today we say no joint replacements if BMI over 40 but tomorrow we say well their weight is 250 so no joint replacement (they are 6’4” with a BMI of 34). Or I don’t like your note…change it.  So it’s changed to mirror one of their old ones (wording, not PE) and it’s still crap and has unneeded info.  Ummm…this was your note from a week ago with all the information you put in your own note.  Surgeon having a meeting with someone that admin was not there and telling me the new office policy is XYZ and admin is scratching their head as they have no clue and not sure what meeting they were talking about.  

I could go on, but with my prior background I had many interactions with docs and surgeons, but it seems ortho are their own beast and to a point a complete disrespect to the PAs.

In Family Med, yes you were the doc and I was the PA but there was a common respect.  In the ER is was similar but we were all in the trenches (felt more military like that the doc was the platoon leader and the PA was the platoon sergeant…there was respect but also knew the chain of command).  Does not feel anything like this in Ortho…just there me up here and you PAs are down there.  In the ER dealing with some of the surgeons was not like it is in the clinic.  There was a level of respect and some guidance/teaching for future cases.

Maybe I am getting too sensitive in my age, but I don’t think so and wanted to ask if it’s just me or similar elsewhere.",1727609908.0

RE: Pitt to offer “Doctor of Chiropractic” program.

I think that most of the NEWER chiropractors and the schools are maybe more interested in heading towards the PT-ish or PT adjacent route. Most of the ADJUSTMENT only research that is published is skewed towards Chiropractors with the adjusting only mentality aka the ones that say chiro cures diabetes. The other research adds exercise, PT, etc to the adjustments or the manipulations. 

I worked as a chiro for 7 years and did PT and Manips, anecdotally i can tell you that my patients that did only adjustments felt better in the short term (ie the day of and a few days later) but in the long term it wasnt as effective as adding other modalities and lifestyle changes. Granted i am talking about patients with no visceral complaints or crazy co morbidities. Just your standard, lower back pain from sitting etc.

RE: How do you reconcile 10/10 symptoms with patient behaviour?,"I would argue that it can be very useful if enough information is gathered.

Second person has 9/10 shoulder pain, only when reaching behind back, settles to 1/10 pain right after…unable to tuck in shirt, belt, difficulties with self care, still able to work, golf, etc

You ask them what their pain is, both would say 9/10 because they want you to know how much it is at its worst and how it’s affecting their life….they only get 5 minutes to sell it to you how bad it is.

Explaining to them basic pain neuroscience (ex. pain as an alarm system, can sometimes be ignored, other times important to listen to) could be more helpful…set their expectations on functional goals, encourage them to keep moving , refer to professionals for help dealing with the pain if significant like PT, CBT therapy, etc 

Do not tell them they are broken or definitely need surgery (unless obviously something major)… I see way too many people told they have a degenerative condition (like DDD, or meniscus tear, torn rotator cuff) and shouldn’t do sports anymore, run, or bend, etc….the body is designed to heal and capable of tremendous potential for activity if done in proper manner..

RE: How do you reconcile 10/10 symptoms with patient behaviour?,"Back in the day when I was young(ish) and had an intermittent enthusiasm for this job I would gently challenge patients. “So if your leg caught fire now your pain would not get any worse since it’s already 10/10? If your living brain was dipped in a vat of acid that would be the same sensation as the one you’re currently experiencing?” And that is of course a completely meaningless exercise. 

There’s in my opinion three kinds of patients that report 10/10 or 9/10 while being objectively not in any distress. 

1) the chronic pain patients who have just given up and always say 10 because they suffer (and they really do) and wish to express this. These patients will also often say that their worst pain is a 16/10 ie beyond the ken of mortal men. “10/10 is a good day for me” I’ve been told.

2) patients who want narcs but can’t even be bothered to put on a good show of actually being in pain. 

3) patient’s who have had the very nasty experience of a, say 6-7/10 and want to communicate that this is scary and not something they’re used to and want to impress upon us that this is really really worrying to them. Here I’ve sometimes had success with asking them to differentiate between how worried they are about the pain and how severe the pain is in itself. “If you knew the cause of the pain, say that we find an appendicitis, would this make the pain more tolerable?”

RE: Florida Department of Health emergently suspends license of physician who removed liver instead of spleen.,"Definitely a solid place for training and one of the better ones. Especially when compared to some of the bottom tier hospitals across the country. I would rank it medium tier and that’s still fairly incredibly tough to get into especially for him being a DO, he would have to have at least above average board scores to be able to a secure spot there. Don’t think his training was an issue. He went several years (15 I think?) without any incidences in Bama at all. He wasn’t a Duntsch. I’m thinking he was having some sort of personal crisis (drugs, exhaustion, fatigue..). Like others mentioned any sane person would have left the liver alone after he cut into the IVC. There’s a million ways you can explain why you cut into the IVC. Patient had mega colon and you couldn’t see the anatomy properly or he wasn’t properly anesthetized and jerked or IVC was displaced, or IVC had a aneurysm. Idk it’s a whole lot easier to explain IVC injury which would be in the realm of rare complication than to take out a liver which is like 0% risk of complication of having your entire liver taken out during a splenectomy. It would raised more than a few eyebrows, sure, he would have been sued at best.  But it wouldn’t be as huge of a blunder as to go ahead and take the liver out and label it as spleen. That part just doesn’t make sense. When patient is coding, you stop surgery and efforts go towards stabilizing patient. I don’t know shit about surgery, I hate ORs. But if one of shittiest and only gen surg rotation taught me anything it was to cauterize, and if it can’t be cauterized you clamp a bleeding vessel and suture it to control bleeding.  That’s what I would have done, initiated massive transfusion protocol and then begged on my knees to get cardiothoracic to get their ass in the OR STAT!

"Tomorrow is my last day working urgent care, and good lord am I relieved to be leaving this specialty ","Not in a million years would I be thinking I'd be posting that headline 4 years ago when I graduated PA school, already completed 2 different urgent care rotations and was eager to get in and get to work. I loved the urgent care setting a lot as a student, enough so I chose to use my 2 elective rotations to do 2 different urgent care rotations. Both of my urgent care rotations were done before COVID.  I graduated at the height of the pandemic (summer 2020) and was thrown into the front lines. 

I started at an urgent care that I actually completed one of my urgent care rotations at, so I was comfortable and familiar with the place. I moved to a smaller, privately owned urgent care 2 years ago (current job). My first job utilized STAT labs, CT, even MRI - therefore we got some pretty high acuity sh\*t that we had to work up (unsafe much?, but great learning experience as a new grad), so I moved to the other urgent care which only had point of care testing and no stat labs or fancy imaging... also closer to home, better pay etc. 

Granted, the perception of a student is WAY different from an actual PA-C working of course - but as a student, I recall that before the pandemic, cases were a) urgent care appropriate, b) None of that ""My primary care doctor sent me here because they couldn't help/see/listen to me"" BS, and c) patients were just way more considerate and receptive to whatever medical advise you had to give. (Ok ok, that last one yes, patients could have been taking my/my preceptor's advice as a grain of salt, but NO ONE was flat out rude and outspoken like they are now. Patients will fight me tooth and nail about even the smallest recommendations I give). 

I could ramble on and on about numerous frustrations in my daily work day, but bottom line - urgent care definitely started as a nice addition to our healthcare system, to help people get quick care for acute, non complicated things. Now?, I feel like post COVID especially, urgent cares have come to just become the dustpan of not only PCP care, but specialty care as well. Numerous patients tell me ""My doctor told me to come here"", most of them saying that their PCP told them to TELL ME, THE PROVIDER, that the patient ""Needs a Chest X ray"" or, ""Needs a prescription for X""... Okay, why don't you order that yourself??. Etc. 

I bet my experience encompasses a lot of other medical professionals out there in all sorts of specialties aside from urgent care...  and I know that I'm probably gonna get a little backlash from assuming thinks were peachy pre-COVID, they definitely were not because HELLO American healthcare system but... COVID just propelled everything into a different universe, mostly causing a huge distrust in our healthcare system and causing patients to question us and our motives. It is really sad.

RE: Pitt to offer “Doctor of Chiropractic” program. Where is this mystic pseudoscientific field headed?,"Not sure how familiar you are with Chiropractic, but if you’d allow, I’d like to (briefly) expand. 

Firstly, I’d acknowledge what others have indicated on this program and it’s possibly a cash grab. I will also acknowledge my profession hasn’t done itself favors in many regards. I’ll also skip over most of my other commentary, at least for now. Final bit, I’m not licensed in PA and don’t know its specifics. 

However, an important part of being a DC is that anyone’s with any condition can come into our office without a referral. I get that many here (and Reddit in general) disagree with that, but that is the reality. And it’s important to understand what that means: a non-chiropractic patient will come into a chiropractor’s office and that chiropractor needs to know when the current treatment for a patient is out of their scope of treatment, despite being inside the realm of what they are expected to recognize and provide a differential diagnosis. 

In that regard, I can’t think of a better place than within medicine to incorporate the training of recognizing these things. I wasn’t evidence-based when I started, but absolutely was before I had finished my chiropractic program. Even the AMA acknowledges benefits of chiropractic - in specific circumstances. 

Where does some of the health-based research come from? Sounds like some would say not this university, but if the other option was chiropractic colleges, which would provide better evidence? 

There are more chiros who are anti-evidence than I want to acknowledge. But, within the profession, the faction growing the fastest is evidence-based. Most schools have gone away from teaching that, regardless of symptoms and presentation, we should x-ray every patient before starting care. That is in line with the changes in the evidence. Emphasizing the diagnosis and the musculoskeletal nature of the care we provide is also following the evidence.

RE: How do you reconcile 10/10 symptoms with patient behaviour?,"When I ask pain level, I generally try to make sure I clarify what a ""0"" means and what a ""10"" means. On a scale from 0-10, 0 being no pain at all, 10 being the worst pain you have ever experienced in your life. Helping put into context what these numbers mean has helped get more accurate measures of their pain. That being said, ""pain"" is in the eye of the beholder, and I always ask, ""who am I to judge someones pain tolerance?""

We provided medication regardless of how we qualified their pain, if we thought that our patient could benefit.

I'm not a big fan of withholding pain medication. If someone is drug seeking and is dependent, what could this patient do if we didn't provide them with medication? Go to the streets to get something that could be laced with fentanyl potentially risking their life or unknowingly overdosing? At least if we manage their medication, we can keep an eye on them. I think good pain management involves taking a good history, understanding their perspective, and using your best judgment.

DEA requires all narcotics to be accounted for. Make sure your documentation is accurate. I am assuming you work with an electronic MAR. Document the dose as given at the time you gave it. Follow your mangers instruction to use the ""bar code unavailable"" option. You have now legally accounted for your narcotic. 

As far as what happens now. Generally nothing. Electronic MARs and pyxis/omnicell machines generate a lot of data about how we pull and pass narcotics. Users whose behavior repeatedly varies from typical behavior get flagged. They may then proceed to audit you and/or watch your behavior. 

But really, in this case, it is super unlikely anything will happen. Packaging gets damaged, the MAR acts up, meds need to be given during downtime. Just remember to slow down and finish your documentation when giving meds. ",1727711624.0

"RE: So are there just hoards of doctors just telling every patient their symptoms are all in their heads, or they're faking, or having period pains? ","Often this is a result of a disconnect between patient expectations and the limitations of medical care. A majority of acute symptoms do not get a definitive diagnosis upon initial presentation. Clinicians are trained to initially evaluate for any potentially serious/life or limb threatening condition followed by consideration a differential list of conditions gradually decreasing in severity. And often it is tincture of time that is the best diagnostic modality because most relatively minor symptoms will resolve with conservative management. Thus the ubiquitous Rx and come back if the symptoms worsen or don't resolve. This method of management is particularly prevalent for acute pain syndromes. However, many patients see the failure of the doc to get an immediate and definitive diagnosis with effective treatment as an abject failure of that physician to appropriately diagnose and treat even if - especially if - the correct diagnosis is made on subsequent followup and testing. And then the patient interpretation of such a situation is that the doctor thinks the pain or symptom is not real etc etc if no diagnosis can be found. Of course there is some truth buried underneath these comments. Modern point-of-care practice focuses on volume over quality and so necessity of efficiency in these practices leads to shorter visits and more conservative care plans ergo Rx and come back if the Sx is still there.

RE: Pitt to offer “Doctor of Chiropractic” program. Where is this mystic pseudoscientific field headed?,"Chiropractic is pseudoscience?!

In the mid-19th century, Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis demonstrated that hand washing could drastically reduce maternal deaths from puerperal fever in maternity wards. Despite clear evidence, the medical establishment at the time rejected his findings. It wasn’t until decades later, after his death, that his approach was accepted.

For centuries, bloodletting was a common medical practice based on the belief that it could cure a wide range of illnesses by balancing the body’s “humors.” This treatment, now known to be dangerous and largely ineffective, was standard until well into the 19th century.

In the 1950s and 1960s, thalidomide was marketed as a safe drug for treating morning sickness in pregnant women. Unfortunately, it caused severe birth defects in thousands of babies. The tragedy revealed major gaps in drug regulation and led to stricter safety protocols for pharmaceutical approval.

Lobotomies were once considered a legitimate treatment for mental illness, particularly for conditions like schizophrenia or severe depression. Developed in the 1930s, the procedure became widely used in the 1940s and 1950s before it was discredited. It often left patients with severe impairments or personality changes, and its wide adoption is now seen as a significant failure of medical ethics.

While antibiotics have saved countless lives, their overuse has contributed to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In the early years of their discovery, antibiotics were prescribed liberally, often unnecessarily, leading to the current global health challenge of drug-resistant infections.

For many years, hormone replacement therapy was widely prescribed to postmenopausal women to protect against heart disease and osteoporosis. However, large studies in the early 2000s revealed that HRT could increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and breast cancer in some women, leading to a significant re-evaluation of the treatment.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, pharmaceutical companies aggressively marketed opioid painkillers, downplaying the risk of addiction. Many doctors were convinced these medications were safe for treating chronic pain, leading to widespread overprescription and the opioid crisis, which has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths due to overdose and addiction.

Tonsillectomies, the surgical removal of the tonsils, were once one of the most common surgeries performed on children, often for relatively mild reasons like sore throats or frequent colds. Over time, evidence showed that the procedure was often unnecessary, and today, it is far less commonly performed.

While ECT is still used in modern psychiatry (in much safer and more controlled ways), its early use was often extreme and poorly understood. In the mid-20th century, it was sometimes applied without anesthesia, causing patients significant distress and trauma. The misuse of ECT became a symbol of the harsh treatment of mental illness in that era.

Diethylstilbestrol (DES) was a synthetic estrogen prescribed to pregnant women between the 1940s and 1970s, believed to prevent miscarriage. However, it was later discovered that DES caused cancer and other serious health problems in the children of women who took the drug. This led to a major medical scandal and increased scrutiny of drug safety in pregnancy.

Chiropractic has very pseudoscience upbringing’s but the research has transformed into a more conservative approach to MSK healthcare. These moments mentioned above, while painful, have often led to greater reforms, stricter regulations, and a better understanding of the human body and medicine. However, they serve as reminders that the medical field is constantly evolving, and humility and openness to new evidence are essential.

-Communicate the plan of care with us. 90% of the time I find out a patient is getting admitted, the doctor has not told me the reasoning of the admission.

Lots of opportunities to be on-call for census reasons if I want to skip half a shift or so. Compared to other hospital bedside jobs it’s a unicorn unit. 

The thing is I still hate it. I’m really introverted and thought I could fake it til I make it but truth is 1.5 years in I can’t. It’s extremely draining for me and I don’t like being a nurse. I’m also working night shifts which is ruining my life but I can’t afford to take the pay cut of days + I’d be even more miserable working days because of how busy it is. I tried OR right out of school and hated it and transferred which is how I ended up bedside, even though I said in school I’d never do bedside. My plan was OR all along but even that fell through. 

Thing is, my mother-in-law-to-be just offered us her old house since they’ve moved. Mortgage + all utilities would be $1k less a month for a house than we’re paying now for an apartment. It’s in our hometown some hour away; cost of living is less and wages are more or less the same. 

My fiancée wants to move and I’d be with her except I’m terrified to change jobs. On one hand I don’t like my job, but it’s a predictable dislike. I will never work a hospital bedside position again because if my unit is the best it gets I don’t want to try anything else. I hate night shifts but my fiancée and I are regardless moving in 1.5 years for her to go to professional school so it’d only be a little bit more of nights because I’ll never take a night shift position again either.

Thing is I’m terrified of trying to find a job somewhere else and hating my life even more. I could try a M-F but what if I hate it more than 3 12s and I miss having 4 days off?

Every organization in this unfortunate story is following their incentives. This insurance company saved more with his death than they would have paid for his treatment and maintenance. Regulatory fees are cheaper than compliance. Psychiatrists and therapists are taking better-paying patients. Hospitals are treating acute issues and discharging. Rehab is restricting access to improve outcomes. Legal action only occurs in the worst cases or from wealthy clientele, who aren't as affected by these issues in the first place due to cash based concierge services and better insurance.

Will a Nursing Externship Boost My Chances of Landing an RN Job Out of State?,"Hi and thank you for reading!

I have my first externship interview coming up next week, and I’m excited but a bit nervous. I’ve done quite a bit of research on nurse externships, and it’s definitely something I want to pursue as part of my long-term career goals.

Currently, I live in the Midwest, but my ultimate goal is to work in California, specifically in Orange County. I’m nervous about how competitive it is to land a job there because I’ve heard California is a wonderful place to work as a nurse. I’m curious to know how viable it is for a new grad like me to get a job in Orange County.

My plan is that if I can get an externship, it will help strengthen my resume and increase my chances of getting a job in California. I’m also thinking about applying to nurse residency programs in my final semester to get more clarity and connection to potential opportunities in California. Worst-case scenario, I can stay in the Midwest and try to land a job through my externship after I graduate and pass the NCLEX.

I have a couple of other questions I hope you all can help with:

1. If I go forward with an externship here in the Midwest, is there an expectation that I’ll stay and work at that hospital afterward? Would it hurt my chances of getting a good reference if I left to pursue a job in California? I’m worried about potentially damaging the relationship with the hospital if I don’t plan on staying long-term.
2. If I take this externship (I’m about 7 months away from graduating from my accelerated nursing program), does the externship count toward nursing experience? For example, if I work for 7 months as an extern, does that count as 7 months of nursing experience on my resume, or is it considered just externship experience?

Also, I feel like this might not be the best question to ask potential employers directly during my interview, which is why I’m turning to Reddit for advice! I’d really appreciate any insights you all have.

Please let me know if my plan is solid or if I’m misunderstanding something. I’d love to be corrected at this stage because I’m still mapping out my decisions to ultimately reach my life goal. Thanks!",1727632300.0

- Help us with minor things. Get them into a gown and on the monitor while you assess them. Get them a cup of water, a blanket, some snacks, etc...

RE: How do you reconcile 10/10 symptoms with patient behaviour?,"I use the Objective Pain and Distress Scale

Verbal
- 0: Cannot Point to Pain

- 2: Points to Specific Area

Vitals
- 0: No Change in VS
- 1: Change in HR / BP 10-20% of the norm

Crying
- 0: Not Crying

Agitation

- 2: Inconsolable Agitation

Movement
- 0: No Guarding

- 2: Involuntary Guarding or Constant Movement to find Position of Comfort

I read about this scale maybe 10-15 years ago in a research paper. I loved it and I’ve used it ever since.

- Basically everyone agrees that a 10 is a 10.
- Most patients are a 3; a 2 for verbal and a “pity point” (credit to my partner) somewhere else.
- It is usable in almost all patients, even children and the elderly, and it doesn’t require that they have the cognitive ability to score their pain.
- the only argument I’ve heard against it is some version of “WOULD YOU WANT SOMEONE TO USE THAT ON YOU?!” Yes. In fact, that’s the checklist I go through when determining what answer I’m going to give when people ask me. Because all pain is bad. The 1-10 doesn’t make sense to me.
- the main argument for me has less to do with patients exaggerating and more to do with the fact that, whether I like it or not, I am more likely to medicate sympathetic populations: the little old ladies, the cancer patients, the very young, etc. This minimizes my bias.

Need Major Advice,"Hi yall this might be long so bear with me. 

I currently work at the hospital as a PCA, I am getting my CNA this week and back in January was doing my prerequisites for nursing school when my life changed course drastically. I got into a bad sledding accident that left me hospitalized for 17 days and in an inpatient rehab center for 47. In June or July I was able to walk for the first time. I finally started back at work this month and now am wanting to return back to school. However I have NO IDEA what my best course of action would be for going to nursing school. 

Originally I was doing my prerequisites and planned on doing a two year RN program and then eventually getting my BSN after. I’ve completed some but still have my full course of anatomy classes to finish as well as making up the other two classes I was unable to finish due to my accident during winter term. 

That being said, I thought about returning back and going along with the original plan however due to my accident I didn’t apply for financial aide this year and would end up having to pay out of pocket if I returned back for winter and spring term. I would also then take longer and have to take summer and fall classes next year as well as possibly winter. Meaning I wouldn’t be able to start my cohort until 2026. 

I feel so impatient but it seems so far away now I’m having a hard time staying motivated. I’ve beaten myself up a lot after the accident as I feel I have none of my stuff together. Not to mention the financial aide aspect. That being said I there is a college nearby that is only 3 years for your BSN and any credits you had from another school will transfer. They don’t require you to do your prerequisites as it’s included in the program and the admittance is based on essays interviews and what not. They also have multiple cohorts going simultaneously (every ten weeks or something like that) so I could start much sooner if I got accepted. The downside is this school is known for being difficult due to poor communication and a lot of independent work. It’s also 96,000 dollars in total. Which while it is about the price of a normal four year BSN near me it’s still so much money I’m having a hard time comprehending it. Not to mention an RN program would only cost me about 25,000 and it would be cheaper to do my RN-BSN after. But the 3 year college is also hybrid which is helpful for me due to my schedule and driving abilities. I don’t know I’m just a little loss and could really use some guidance and motivation. What would you do if you were in my situation? 


Also if someone could please explain to me how student loans worked out for yall. Does it start after you graduate or before? I thought after but some of this stuff I’ve been reading is confusing. I’m just a bit overwhelmed. 


Thank you and sorry for it being so long! 

Edit: Also I realized another option would be to do the all or as many prereqs as I can at my current college and still apply to both two years and the three year program as if I did go to the three year program it would save me some money. ",1727682566.0

Patient stated no bowel movement for approx. a week (pre + post op), no passing gas either and also was experiencing abdominal pain. Only peppermint water was given. On day 8 the pt was given an enema due to an impaction.

Personally, I do still check those patients Q15 as much as I can, but I chart “alternatives to sitter -> increased frequency of nursing rounds” because I’m not gonna lie and chart that I’m actually 1:1 when I’m not.

This all leads to lower revenue. Some research has found that patients treated by women physicians had lower readmission rates than those treated by men, which can lower costs for health systems. These practice approaches are important aspects of patient-centered care. In a system that pays for the quantity of services provided, rather than the quality of care, women — or any physicians who provide patient-centered care — may be at a disadvantage.

Your own study pointed it out. But nowhere did you mention it was controlled for.

The issue is with the incentives behind what drives care. If it's quantity and revenue then doctors who see more patients get paid more.",1727407187.0

RE: Should I quit my job or tough it out?,"I think the fact that you're not fired means they still think you can do it. It's not like it's incredibly difficult to make up a reason to fire you. If they told you this, then you should be asking them what their recommendation is to get you to be where you should be -- reading up on study material, patient load, education, etc.

Then once they tell you what to improve on, make sure to take notes and sell to them every step of your progress. For example, if they say your differentials are too narrow, go into up-to-date and make a template for ""evaluation of xxx"". Then the next day run the template past your SP and ask if there is anything to add/remove. With that feedback, you'll get a feel for how the expectations of the clinic are and align yourself with those expectations.

I worked as a clerk before PA school with an ED doc once who was brand new out of residency. When he would admit a patient, he ran tests that I never heard of and admit patients with diagnoses that I had never heard of either. For example, most ED docs would admit with a diagnosis ""chest pain"". He would admit for ""rule out myocarditis vs demand ischemia vs ACS"". He was helping out the hospitalists immensely, but his wait times exceeded the average physician times because the tests he would run and time spent on admission ddx. Well, he was nearly fired because his wait times were longer than everyone else's and, unbeknownst to him, wait times were that physician groups most important metric. He was doing everything right except communicating with his bosses about their expectations for the position. Perhaps you are in this type of situation.

It's not uncommon for people to spend their first few months getting accustomed to the pace of a new clinic/working environment. A difference in pace between clinic preference and your preference isn't a sign that you need to get out, but rather it should be a sign that you gotta step it up a bit. Maybe cut out the fat in your patient education. Maybe tighten up or broaden your ddx (up-to-date is awesome for broadening, cutting out zebras it an easy way to tighten).

Not all of them.  The female ones.  Apparently.

This is your friendly reminder that it's standard of care not to provide any anesthetic for a colposcopy, a procedure where a literal chunk of flesh is carved out of part of your reproductive system, and that until a month ago, it was not standard of care to provide anesthetic for IUD insertion despite widespread attestation to it being agonizingly painful.

A physician doesn't have to be a bastard or openly antagonistic to women to routinely torture women and disregard their suffering.  A physician doesn't even have to be male.  One of the most eye-opening experiences of my Reddit life was being a fly on the wall over in r/residents, listening to a bunch of women obgyn residents discuss, ""Hey, uh, so why *don't* we use any sort of anesthetic for colposcopies?""

But, of course, there are physicians (including women physicians) who do have contempt for women patients and their pain.  It can be very quiet and not announce itself.  It can just manifest in warmly patronizing ""reassurance"" that nothing is really wrong, delivered in advance of any assessment, imaging, or testing whatsoever.

I got records from the outside facility that showed she got ekg and troponin x2, a chest x-ray, a d dimer as well as other basic labs.

RE: SEASONED NURSES PLEASE GIVE ADVICE,"First, it sounds a bit like you’ve made up your mind and you’re hoping that someone else will tell you it’s OK to do. This isn’t wrong and even if this is the case, I’ll say it — It’s OK to pick the more acute hospital.

What you need to be OK with is that you go into it knowing that your 12 hour shifts may really end up being 13-14, that you may not get a proper lunch based on the description, and that you’re more likely to burn out more quickly. 

Do you know the units turn over? You may also find, after a few months in, you end up being one of the “experienced” nurses on your shift. Even as an experienced RN, that’s a signal to run.

If you are OK with the above or OK with jumping ship early if you decide it’s too painful, then you’ve gone into it with what you need to know.

That said, having psychological safety is essential for good learning. Maslow’s hierarchy of needs applies to being able to learn and manage the self care necessary to recover from the work. 

The first two years as a nurse are some of the hardest — even if you’ve worked on the unit or in the hospital before.

The US obviously has widely disparate insurance companies that don’t have any control individually.  This plus the insane cost of advertising direct to consumer leads to monopolistic type behaviour.

Deposition Questions,"**EDIT: A whole bunch of fuss about nothing, as the case settled out two days after they sent me the subpoena.**  
  
Hey y'all, I searched to see what had already been asked, but it was pretty scarce so figured I'd see if I could get any other answers.

I was served a subpoena to be a fact witness in a case. None of the rendering providers involved, myself included, have been named as defendants. I have three main questions.

1. I am no longer working for the same employer but would like to review the chart/records from that patient encounter ahead of the deposition. To muddy the waters a bit, though, I was working in an ED at the time, but employed by a CMG rather than by the hospital itself. Who would I reach out to in order to get those records? **The law firm requesting the deposition already had the records available and was able to provide my notes to me more quickly than either my former hospital or CMG.**
2. I would like to either discuss the deposition ahead of time with a lawyer, or have one present during the deposition. I don't foresee being added to the defendant list, but would like to cover my bases. Since this happened while employed elsewhere, is this something that my old employer's legal team and/or malpractice coverage would do for me? Or is this where I look for outside counsel? **My current employer reached out to their legal team to provide someone to speak to about this ahead time, and the CMG that used to employ me also put me in touch with their legal team to answer my questions and go over how to approach the deposition.**
3. As a fact witness, I know that there can be payment/fees involved, but I'm not sure what a fair amount would be. I will need to take time off from work in order to complete the deposition. I know a couple of malpractice defense attorneys that I can ask to get their take, but wanted to hear from this community, too. **In Illinois where I'm located, fact witness have a standard rate of $20/day and $0.20 per mile traveled, but the requesting party can pay higher rates at their discretion for the value of time spent.**

"RE: New PA job - having second thoughts, anxious","I’m also a new grad starting off in a specialty, and I started my job about 5 weeks ago! My training is 6 months long, but after 5 weeks I already feel so much more comfortable than I did when I started (and when I started I was terrified truthfully). By no means do I think I’m an expert, and I am thankful to have more time to train; but I think if I had to be on my own starting tomorrow, I’d be ok. I say that because I’ve learned a ton, but more importantly I have fostered great relationships with the docs I’m working with, and have collected tons of resources to reference as needed. I feel like I can consult them whenever needed, and that’s a huge benefit when starting off in a specialty. 

I think it would be worth asking for additional training time — maybe you could have your own patients on the 2 days your MD is gone, and then spend the other 3 days with him for an additional time period after your 4 weeks of “training.” That could be a good compromise for both you and the practice, and you could build up to being completely on your own. 

That being said, if that’s not an option, I would glean as much as you can from your first 4 weeks, find some solid Allergy/Asthma/Immunology resources, and then have an honest conversation with your MD so he knows where you’re at and can be there to support you, even when he’s not in clinic. 

Ultimately I think if your MD is training you and deems you ready for clinic in 4 weeks then you will be just fine. You might have to spend more time studying and charting than the average new grad at first, but I think it will be a great learning experience and make you an even stronger clinician.

I can't say I don't have any support either, because technically there is a full time doctor, but how much one person can ask for help? 

I have more troubles answering the questions from the nurses all night, as that is my duty as a cross-coverage person. I am only surviving due to the best pharmacists in my hospital, I don't know what would have happened without them. I wish I had somebody to talk to ; whenever I see first year medical residents  I get a little jealous because they are always there with the 3rd year. But in my hospital, I am all by myself, trying to figure it out on my own. 

I don't even know if I am doing the right thing- for example initially pt presents with hyperphos, then on his few nights at the hospital he gets critically low phos, and nurse messages me to replenish, and I am replenishing it, is that ok? I don't have time to read the charts or notes because there will be back-to-back nurses messaging me in the early morning and the progress notes are not clear cut either. Or I have a knowledge gap. 

I get stuck when they message me about bradycardia, or tele is showing them junctional rhythm, or mobiz type 1, and my doctor is not around, not responding, have their own ""shit show running"". All I do is tell the nurse if the pt is symptomatic or not (thank God no one has ever told me symptomatic). 

Now i am even starting to question how much fluids to give, the other day some doctor left with continuous fluid and I had to give them lasik. How much damage I am doing by giving people dilaudid or morphine or ketorolac? Nurses asks for pain meds and I just send the order. 

Is this just a learning curve, or there are better ways to learn without getting stuck or trying so hard to figure out?

Least you could do is throw out the sharps and throw out the trash. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve almost cut myself on bloody sharps because they’re hidden under dirty gauze. 

- bundling orders. I’m sure others below have already mentioned it but if someone is gonna need a full work up and treatment, I’d rather go in the room ready with all my supplies and do everything I need to do in 30-60 min than have to constantly be coming in and out of room, grabbing supplies, meds, new tubes, etc because you keep putting a new order in every 10 min.

"New PA job - having second thoughts, anxious","Need to vent to a community that understands what I’m feeling. New grad PA about to start my first job. Signed on with a busy Allergy, Asthma, Immunology clinic, scheduled to work M-F 40 hrs a week. No weekends or call. Landed with a good doc and staff, but since signing the other PA has quit and when I start next week it will only be the MD and me.

The real kicker is that I only will receive 4 weeks of “training,” and during those training weeks the MD will be absent two days a week. After training, I see patients on a full schedule 5 days a week and, again, the MD will only be present 3 days a week. Which means as a brand new provider, I will be by myself two days a week in a busy allergy clinic with barely any training.

Am I overthinking this? I am so nervous. I feel like I picked the right job but ever since hearing the other PA left I have regretted signing the contract.

I would not want either of those jobs if I had significant joint problems.

But non-surgical jobs pretty much you are sitting or standing. You do walk more as a PA than an office job but nothing physically demanding. We are not doing much (or sometimes any) bedside care like nurses or nurse aides that would be bad on our backs.

"RE: NPs sue NY for not being paid the same as physicians, stating it is due to ""gender discrimination"". Thoughts?","Most women want to have kids, and want to actually spend time with their kids.

It also means accepting 0.4 and 0.5 FTE schedules with a huge decrease in pay even hour by hour or by wRVU. Men might want to have kids but we've all heard the often true stereotypes of surgeons for example not being there for major milestones in the kid's lives as a result.  It's a tradeoff with major consequences on either side, but being very available as a physician work wise means higher pay and a terrible schedule.  This isn't to say either is wrong, but there are huge costs on either side that any individual has to pick what downside they can deal with.  The flipside is for women to think about their husband going 0.4 FTE at a 60% paycut to take care of the kids while they are the primary breadwinners.  A few choose that, but not the majority.

RE: How do you reconcile 10/10 symptoms with patient behaviour?,"My perspective from the ER is people get the benefit of the doubt at least until w/u is back.

Chronic patient are little more complicated. Sickle Cell is the classic example in EM. Again, I give the benefit of the doubt, they have real disease that can cause real pain. That being said if it is someone coming in multiple days in a row and refusing admission/refusing to trial oral meds etc... I will start pushing back.

RE: Venting,"Coming from a family of first responders, no one is terribly sensitive in my circles, but I have noticed that when I get particularly gripy about my patients, it’s time to cut back and take some time off. 

Sometimes, if not most of the time, venting gets me in a negative headspace, and having been in counseling for burnout, I know where that will lead. 

It weird, right? I mean, the reason we call it venting is because it’s what we do to “let off steam” when we are stressed, but there comes a point where it stops helping and really just makes us miserable, and tends to make the people around us miserable too. 

It’s a tough career. I don’t really hang out with other PAs or NPs. More than anything, I prefer to hang out with my old paramedic co-workers from my EMS days. There’s just something isolating about being a PA. 

Anyway, one thing I learned from my counseling was that my venting about patients really had more to do with unrealized anxiety and unmet expectations. Learning to manage those things better made the frustrations from my patients have less of an effect on me, and over time, I lost the need to vent.

""According to staff, when patient W.B.’s abdomen was opened, a megacolon − or an abnormal dilation of the colon − ""burst out of the abdominal cavity, disrupting visibility,” an incident FDOH says Shaknovsky did not document.

“While OR staff cleared the field by moving the large colon and suctioning blood, Shaknovsky identified a vessel that he intended to cut and noted that he could feel it pulsing under his finger. He told the staff member assisting him, ‘that’s scary.’ Shaknovsky grabbed the vessel, positioned a surgical stapling device around it, and fired the stapler,” the emergency order described. “Immediately after performing the dissection, patient W.B. began to severely hemorrhage and went into cardiac arrest. OR staff members observed a significant amount of blood pouring out, immediately disrupting visibility in the field.”

While staff began efforts to save the patient’s life, Shaknovsky “stayed in the patient’s abdomen and continued dissecting even though the abdomen was full of blood and there was no visibility.” The report said he did not ask staff for a clamp or cauterizer and fired the stapling device “blindly” into the patient’s abdomen. He eventually removed the man’s liver and identified it as his spleen, the order said.

**Man dies on operating table:**[Alabama man dies in Destin hospital after surgeon removes wrong organ. How it happened.](https://www.thedestinlog.com/story/news/local/2024/09/03/florida-surgeon-dr-thomas-shaknovsky-removed-alabama-man-liver-instead-of-spleen-in-destin/75054297007/)

“Spleens and livers are anatomically distinct, have different consistencies, and are different colors,” the emergency order notes. “Additionally, the spleen is located on the left side of the abdomen while the liver is on the right side. The staff looked at the readily identifiable liver on the table and were shocked when Dr. Shaknovsky told them it was a spleen. One staff member felt sick to their stomach.”

Despite the staff’s “best efforts,” the report said, the patient passed. FDOH said Shaknovsky requested the organ be labeled as a “spleen” and sent to pathology and although the person responsible for labeling it knew it was not a spleen they “did as they were instructed.” According to staff, Shaknovsky then left the operating room but returned three times after that, each time stating that the patient's “splenic artery aneurysm ruptured and that was what caused the bleeding.”

“The staff in the room felt that Dr. Shaknovsky was attempting to convince them that this is what occurred, even though they witnessed something different,” the order said.

During the autopsy, the medical examiner noted that patient W.B.’s spleen was still intact and that his liver was missing. The medical examiner also noted that the inferior vena cava had been severed, which is the largest vein in the body and brings deoxygenated blood from the body back to the heart for new oxygen. The inferior vena cava connects the liver to the heart.

“Based on these findings, Dr. Shaknovsky dissected patient W.B.’s inferior vena cava, resulting in the bleeding event that precipitated his death,” the emergency order said.""

RE: Deposition Questions,"You need to talk to a lawyer. Either one you pay a fee to consult with or the lawyer of the defendant if you feel that is appropriate, though if there is ANY chance you could be targeted in the suit, you really need your own lawyer who is looking out soley for you. If at all possible you should have a phone or video call with a lawyer before the deposition where you are prepared for what will be asked and how to respond.

In a deposition, the less information you provide, the better (in general). The biggest mistake you can often make is to talk more than necessary. If a question can be answered by yes/no, just state yes/no and be quiet. If you are unsure if a question was appropriate to be asked, ideally a lawyer on your side there is involved and you can nod to them or ask them how to proceed. When replying, treat it like writing the most CYA chart ever. Be vague when appropriate, do not overstep what you could factually know, and do not implicate anyone (especially yourself) when instead things could be left to uncertainty.

As you brought up any chance of being added to the defendant list, I would absolutely not go about looking to be compensated for this. Your only priority should be to protect your license.

Hope this winds up being a whole bunch of nothing. Court stuff sucks, even if you are not the one who has something to lose. Just keep your cool and pause before answering and think before speaking.

RE: How do you reconcile 10/10 symptoms with patient behaviour?,"I have worked in pharmacy since 2008. You would be surprised what people will overuse. Several patients run out of their Wellbutrin too early. We have 2 patients right now that we treat it like a control for and only allow it a few days early. Propranolol is another. Imitrex, too. Fioricet and Fiorinal, even though some butalbital products aren't controlled. 

Plenty of people lose their birth controls and Lisinopril. We just get them an override with their insurance and they use a refill. Their doctors never know. Insurance also allows really early refills on non controls. Some medicare d plans allow you to refill when you are at 65%. That's almost a month early on a 3 month supply. 

Not that opiates aren't misused. Trust me. My store doesn't even stock oxycodone 30 mg anymore, and we keep hitting ordering limits and are unable to order many opiates. And other stores won't fill for our patients bc they have their own limits. The pendulum has swung way too far. There are very few new opiate patients these days. Most of these people have been on them for years. Holding people to the 30th day is mean, and many pharmacies do this now.

Best handheld ultrasound for hospital medicine?,"I'm an academic hospitalist working in a high-acuity institution. I've got some stipend/department money to use, and have been looking into getting a handheld ultrasound.

Unfortunately, our access to decent ultrasound machines has always been fraught, of the ""there's a machine somewhere on the floor, maybe try the micu?"" variety. We also bed two to a room (!!!) so getting a machine physically inside is usually a struggle.

I trained just before ultrasound really came into its own on the floors, so my experience is basically non-existent beyond the once a year courses we get on them, which I retain basically nothing from due to lack of application.

RE: Is it inappropriate to shave a comatose patient?,"Hello. CRNA here who worked trauma/transplant/surgical ICU for many years. 

1.) when it comes to grooming and basic care, Consent is implied if they are comatose, and lying in a hospital bed. 
2.) shaving isn’t surgery or a permanent removal of anything that won’t grow back. It’s only facial hair. It grows back very fast. 
3.) patients always do better when they feel better. 
4.) I’ve always seen a positive physiological response to grooming (bathing, hair washing, a foot massage, shaving a man’s face). Patients rest and heal when they FEEL better. And everyone feels better when our bodies are clean and well cared for. A comatose patient cannot attend to their own needs. As nurses, we are the ones that need to care for all of their needs, including grooming. 

Bathing and grooming patients was required back when I was an ICU nurse. It was an expectation of the nurses job. It was done every night shift. All patients got a bath. If you had time to shave and wash their hair, even better. If they were there long enough, you trimmed their nails too.

RE: Does Wernicke encefalopathy arise because of alcohol withdrawal or is it just most frequently seen in these patients?,"From UTD:

“Thiamine is a cofactor for several key enzymes important in energy metabolism, including transketolase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase [1]. Thiamine requirements depend on metabolic rate, with the greatest need during periods of high metabolic demand and high glucose intake. This is manifest by the precipitation of WE in susceptible patients by administration of intravenous (IV) glucose before thiamine supplementation [33].

Evidence for the role of thiamine in WE is supported by observations that the thiamine antagonist pyrithiamine causes experimental thiamine deficiency in rats, resulting in a sequence of ataxia, loss of the righting reflex, and convulsions [34,35]. In some cases, low levels of magnesium, an essential cofactor of thiamine into its active diphosphate and triphosphate forms, have been implicated with thiamine deficiency in WE [36].

Because of the role of thiamine in cerebral energy utilization, it has been proposed that its deficiency initiates neuronal injury by inhibiting metabolism in brain regions with high metabolic requirements and high thiamine turnover. Events such as blood-brain barrier breakdown, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor-mediated excitotoxicity, and increased reactive oxygen species have been implicated in thiamine deficiency-induced neurotoxicity [37].

Thiamine deficiency in individuals with chronic heavy alcohol use results from a combination of inadequate dietary intake, reduced gastrointestinal absorption, decreased hepatic storage, and impaired utilization [38].

Not all thiamine-deficient individuals with chronic heavy alcohol use develop WE. Greater susceptibility among identical rather than fraternal twins suggests a genetic predisposition [37]. Investigators have found that in individuals with chronic heavy alcohol use and WE, the thiamine-dependent enzyme transketolase has an altered affinity for thiamine [39-47]. Variants in the high-affinity thiamine transporter gene have also been implicated [48,49].”

My last ortho practice was very close knit and we all supported each other. I only left because I didn’t like taking call as much as the job required.


Ortho is still in a large growth period across the board. It produces lots of money so lots of innovation and many practices are establishing new standards of care. Also as new studies come out, practices should be changing.

Previously every joint case was done in the hospital now most can be done same day in the ASC. With robotics and newer implants you can push the BMI limits and as surgeons become more comfortable across their career they will adapt. Also if it is a slow period they want to still earn they will sometimes be forced to take on cases they wouldn’t normally do.

I make absolutely certain that I tell my patients that I cannot make their pain zero, I can't make it a go away because it's part of the underlying disease process. But if I can make it tolerable then that's my goal. 

On the other hand, if I observe that patients are excessively sleeping too during the day, severely constipated or difficult to arouse, then those are my obvious indications to pull back.

Typically, even with my patients who have chronic pain or chronic opiate dependence, I find that discussing this approach with them takes off a lot of stress and conflict than me feeling their 10 out of 10 pain looks pretty comfortable from the door to the room.

You can look at community colleges, liberal arts colleges and teach bio, A & P, general studies. You can also teach adjunct.

New Grad Fast Track EM Training ,"Hi all! I was offered a fast track EM job at a teaching hospital. I haven’t shadowed the place yet but I just got a tour of the ED today. We’re in the process of scheduling a shadowing day but I wanted to give them a decision about the offer. They are looking to hiring 4 candidates so that we would be on rotating shifts. The fast track area is connected to triage so I will be expected to help with triage if needed. It’s also connected to the main ED but I won’t be responsible for those patients. I was told that shadowing period would be 2-3 weeks and then you’re on your own but you have support from the attending who will be in the main ED. 

My biggest thing I’m worried about is that it’s my first job and I feel like 2-3 weeks of training is really short. I want to ask for at least 2-3 months because I think it will be overwhelming to get used to the EMR, working up patients, reading imaging, etc. I feel like this is a big red flag that their training is this short and I don’t know if they would be willing to really extend it even if they say ok if I ask.

Having a spouse or family NOT in healthcare is tough, and to be honest with you, even when your spouse or family is in healthcare, they still sometimes do not get it.

They don't get that we are trained to be objective when dealing with patients, and that doing so is the only way to provide the best care. They don't understand that when you deal with life and death all day, making a joke about dying is either a way of coping or just a reflection of your day in day out work. They also don't understand that when you have to tell a patient and their family that a 20, 30, 40 or 50 year old is dying, that seeing a 70 or 80 year old die to you, it's pretty normal to think ""I mean, they made it to average, what's the big deal?"" Or after telling someone they have an incurable cancer, it's kind of hard for your next visit to show a bunch of fake compassion about unresolved ankle pain or neuropathy or whatever. It does not make you a bad person. Our jobs do this to us. We have to think like this to do our jobs.

Honestly, sometimes I think we should not even try to talk about our work with non-healthcare providers (or a step further, if you are doing acute care or in a field with a lot of mortality, to talk with those also dealing with such matters). They are flat out NOT going to get it, no matter how much you try to explain things to them.

Can I just rant for a second? ,"Hey everybody I’m a private duty peds nurse and have been working my current case since the end of July. I relocated back to my home state a few months ago, so I’ve only been with my agency since the beginning of July. I can’t stand my current case. I guess if I start from day one, Mom never gave me any in home training. I showed up on my first day, she handed me the patient, and stayed in her room until my shift was over and she needed to sign my charting. The patient is not medically complex and the most “nurse” thing I do during my shift is my baseline assessment and change a g button dressing, but showing me how you like your child to be cared for is bare minimum. The agency provides skills training but patient specific training is on the family/ other nurses in the home. This was a brand new case for the agency and I am the only nurse on the case. 

The Mom hardly communicates with me, on most occasions it’s just a good morning when she opens the door upon my arrival and that’s it. I’m not a chatty person myself, so that doesn’t bother me but there are other things she does not communicate with me. My patient has a few different services that come during the week and Mom never tells me when they’re coming (they do not come on the same days/times each week), and I am in the home alone with the patient for the majority of my shift. It’s uncomfortable to have someone show up unexpectedly to a home that is not mine. Most of the time, the other services will show up while the patient is napping (they’re under a year old) so I’ll have to interrupt her sleep and deal with a very fussy baby later. The patient has had one doctors appointment since I’ve started and Mom didn’t mention the appointment until the day before. She also didn’t mention that we would be taking public transportation (The bus and train) to get to said appointment, I didn’t realize until we walked out of the house and stood at the bus stop. I didn’t have cash on me, but luckily our city has an app and you can buy your tickets that way. I didn’t have an issue with this, it just would’ve been nice for her to tell me.I have mentioned to the agency that Mom does not communicate with me and nothing has come of it. 

Mom did ask me back in August after one of my shifts if I could come in an hour early for the next TWO WEEKS, as her other child has no transportation for school and she would need to take them on the bus herself. I agreed, since it would only be for two weeks, but as of this week, this will make it WEEK SEVEN that I have been coming in at 7am instead of 8am. Mom has not given me any updates this entire time. My agency came out to the home on Monday for a visit and I mentioned it to them, told them I would like to go back to the original schedule, and they said they would reach out to Mom. agency reached out to Mom a few days later and emailed me saying Mom still needs me to come in at 7am and that they’re sorry for any inconvenience. I know an hour may seem like no big deal to most people but I’m over it and I only agreed to this for 2 weeks. 

Mom has also left me in the home with the patient with no baby formula for the first 3 hours of my shift and as of last week no baby food to give in between formula feeds. She also locks the feeding pump in her room when she’s not in the home, so the every 3 hour feeds are stretched farther apart if the patient is napping. 

When I started with the agency, I had a high tech night shift case, but I could not get into the swing of night shift so I was given this case. I feel like a babysitter and I dread my shifts everyday. I feel bad asking to be removed from this case since I asked to be removed from the night shift case back in July. I don’t want to seem difficult and risk my job. I’m almost 21 weeks pregnant and need a consistent source of income. I also know the likelihood of finding a replacement nurse is not likely because of the neighborhood the patient lives in, and the home not being in the best condition, on top of Mom just starting to work. If I leave the case she would likely have to quit her job. I feel stuck in this case and I can’t stand it.

I know this was lengthy so thank you to anyone who read this all the way through.",1727619994.0
"RE: So are there just hoards of doctors just telling every patient their symptoms are all in their heads, or they're faking, or having period pains?

RE: Question about Billing as a PA and working in a place predominantly NP-based,"These are the rules for incident to billing, recently updated by CMS.  This is copied and pasted from their website.

In order to bill a service as incident-to, the [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/clm104c12.pdf) has several requirements, including that: 

* Only established patients seen by a credentialed NPP for a follow-up appointment can be billed as incident-to
* The supervising physician must be present in the office suite when services are being rendered by the NPP
* The supervising physician must actively participate in the course of treatment
* The medical services must take place in a noninstitutional setting (e.g., Place of Service 11)
* Both the NPP and the supervising physician must be credentialed by Medicare; and
* The NPP must be an employee of the supervising physician’s practice 

Incident-to billing is not consistent with CMS rules if:

* The patient is new
* An established patient presents with new medical complaints 
* Only one provider is credentialed by Medicare (e.g., the physician is credentialed but the NPP is not); or
* The supervising physician is not present in the office suite

  
So simply put; the physician needs to be in the office at the time of the visit, the patient cannot be new to the practice nor can an established patient be seen for a new complaint.  In those situations where incident-to billing applies; you bill like normal, though the practice will bill under the physician's NPI.  In any of those exclusionary scenarios, the patient is billed under your NPI.

Technically, you will always chart and bill like you normally do.  This is on the admin/billing staff to sort.",1727467624.0

Interview Nephrology Prep New Grad,"Hi! I know that it’s been posted probably numerous times already what types of questions to prepare for as a new grad about to interview with the Supervising Physician, but I’d love to ask about specifically the specialty of Nephrology.

"RE: So are there just hoards of doctors just telling every patient their symptoms are all in their heads, or they're faking, or having period pains? ","I think it's multifactorial. Yes, there are some docs who are quick to jump on the anxiety/weight/period excuse train. I, myself was told by my pediatrician that my knee pain was due to being overweight and I needed to exercise more. He had apparently forgotten that he sees me every year for sports physicals for year-round varsity sports. And as many have pointed out, women's issues are often the worst when it comes to misdiagnosis and medical gaslighting. The only situation in which we routinely do biopsies without any anesthetic (not even local) is the cervix/vagina; it takes an average of >5 years of excruciating ""period pain"" before a diagnosis of endometriosis is made. I've seen multiple patients put on anxiety meds before tests for thyroid function are done (and found abnormal).

That being said there's definitely an element of misperception on the part of the patients. There's a belief  that we should know what's going on and be able to run all the tests right now. This seems especially true in the ED. Patients will come in for subacute or chronic problems and expect that I can run every test they need right then and there. Despite my best efforts to explain that we've reached the diagnostic limit of the ED and their PCP/specialist needs to take the baton for the next leg of investigation, that still often gets misinterpreted as saying there's nothing wrong with them. I have literally said to a patient ""I believe there's something going on, and I don't know what it is."" just to have the patient immediately say ""So you're saying there's nothing wrong with me"".

RE: Question for ED Nurses from an ED Doctor,"This. 

I work in an ED where none of our docs communicate with us regarding plan of care and this results in not only delayed patient care but built up frustration between both professions. It will save everyone a lot of time if you quickly have a 20 second chat with the bedside nurse before you see the patient and say “any concerns.” This allows us to mention concerns and for us to relay our assessment and understand a plan of care. Moreover, if we need something for nausea or pain that isn’t urgent we can voice that which will save you a lot of time so you don’t have someone bothering you every two seconds. You won’t be clicking in and out of charts for everyone concern that someone brings to you at a random moment. In my ED docs are constantly interrupted which frustrates them resulting in conflict for something that the patient needs. This angers nursing because get insulted or talked down to for addressing patient needs and when people stand up for themselves it becomes blown of proportion. If a culture established where everyone knows that you’ll talk to the team then people won’t bother you for non urgent issues and instead have all their information ready to present when you come by. Lots the time if you say “any concerns” the answer will be no if everyone is being diligent and addressing those concerns.

I've worked with a number of NPs over the years, they are a mixed bag, not unlike physicians.  One who just left our group should have been fired years ago.  The stuff I've discovered while taking over part of her panel makes me shudder. None of it is about brains, it's all about attention and giving a shit, but I have seen MD/DOs like that, too.  I would argue a smaller proportion, but they exist.

Another NP spent the three years of COVID in the ICU and when the medical director said I had to precept her for  minor procedures (ones I had trained her in before she went to the ICU) I told them to get stuffed.  She spent three years intubating people, putting in central lines, etc.  I was fairly sure she could handle inserting and removing contraceptive devices again.  Which she did.  I would hire her anywhere, anytime, for pretty much anything.

For mid-levels I generally prefer PAs, who at this point can't go to school on-line, but a friend of mine who is a Vietnam-era PA points out that PAs are trained in our model, are either ex-military independent duty corpsmen who went on to PA as a way to utilize their skills civilian-side, most of the younger ones I've met didn't WANT to be doctors.

One instructor said that everyone had their families brought into the hospital, including pets. Local nearby families had brought over everything in their fridge and freezers and made them home cooked meals daily (as the food would’ve gone bad at their homes anyways). She said that the hospital had OPEN BARS for staff when they were off. 
Her and her husband stayed in an office for days with their dog and she says her patient load was less than her usual one. 

Another instructor told us about his best friend who was at charity and had to wear plain clothes and deny being a nurse because she had been held at gun point multiple times by people who wanted drugs; she ended up leaving nursing after the hurricane because of the PTSD she suffered from even wearing her scrubs. 

I was a kid when Katrina hit and I remember the chaos of the national guard riding and walking around with big ass guns and machine guns mounted to cars. I remember everything being damaged and closed and the absolute eerie absence of light at night- with even scarier sounds. My single mom only stayed a couple of days and we ended up bouncing around to different states to anyone that would have us- and sleeping in the car at rest stops or putting cheap motels on a credit card because she said the city just wasn’t safe for us to stay.

Leaving After 1 Year????,"Hello, I am a new oncology pharmacist who just completed my PGY2 this past June. I have been at my first oncology position for a few months now and i absolutely hate the culture at my new institution. I feel like everyone here is extremely jaded, do not take the time to properly counsel or follow up with patients, and do not utilize their pharmacists outside of having me fix treatment plans or complete prior authorizations.

Additionally, the opportunities presented to me during the interview are vastly different than reality - unable to teach or precept students/ residents at all, no potential for research, and no potential for attending ANY conferences.

The thing that bothers me the most is the lack of empathy for patients. At my previous hospital, my colleagues always put patient needs first no matter how jaded or tired or annoying it was. Everyone always went above and beyond to make sure patients understood what was going on and routinly follow up for AE monitoring and adherance. Here, no one cares. Patients are handed a chemo handout and pushed out the door. No one follows up to make sure meds are taken properly. When patients reach out to discuss AE, it's always a burden to everyone except me.  The only patients they care about arethe ""VIP"" patients who pay $$$ to the hospital.

I feel so slimy, tired, and disheartened to be a part of this hospital. I love oncology and I love my patients but I don't know if I can stick this out. I want to start looking for other positions and leaving after 1 year, but I am nervous only staying at a job for 1 year will look bad on my resume.  Should I stick it out for 2 years? Is 1 year enough to justify leaving? What do I tell prospective employers?? Will this hurt me when it comes to finding a new position?? Thanks ❤️

Do pharmacists in the United States believe that they will be replaced by artificial intelligence?," Hello,

I'm not sure if you remember me, but I am the pharmacist working in South Korea who previously asked you about the situation of pharmacists in the United States. ([https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/1fni2mr/can\_the\_future\_of\_pharmacists\_change/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/1fni2mr/can_the_future_of_pharmacists_change/)))

In South Korea's online communities, there is talk about pharmacists being replaced by artificial intelligence or even vending machines.

I believe this is often just another case of hate speech directed towards certain professions, which is common online. However, as a pharmacist who has always had an interest in programming, and even artificial intelligence, I’m starting to find it harder to simply dismiss what they're saying.

  
Since the role of pharmacists in South Korea and the United States differs, I think perspectives on the topic of being replaced by artificial intelligence might also vary, which is why I’m writing this here.

However, when it comes to tasks that pharmacists commonly perform, such as checking for drug interactions or monitoring for adverse reactions, I have a strong feeling that AI might soon be able to handle these tasks even better.

  
I would appreciate it if you could share your thoughts on the potential replacement of pharmacists by artificial intelligence in your area. If you believe that pharmacists won’t be replaced, it would be helpful if you could provide specific reasons and examples to help me better understand.



Thank you.

Dispensing off label medicines,"This is somewhat of a tricky question and would appreciate any insight or advice:

Uk based in England

Company is the seller of self test IVD to consumer. This device is for the aid of diagnosis of a GI disease by a healthcare professional. For the diagnostic test, the IVD requires a substrate sachet (this is lactulose 10g/200ml).

How can the company provide the sachet substrate inside the box of the IVD device? 

Spoken to a friend who works for a similar company that has the following set up: he send a pdf prescription for 1000 sachets of lactulose to an online pharmacy. This prescription is more of a purchase order than an actual prescription. There are no patient details. He just asks for the sachets to be sent to address XYZ and signs with his name and credentials (he’s a prescriber). Every time a patient buys a kit, he issues a prescription for off label use of lactulose with the patient details, and then the sachet is included in the box of the testing kit. 

Is this legal?

I love following certain people because they are reasonable and then other people do things out of left field so instead of spending my day actually reviewing patients and trying to make interventions I’m cleaning up after people who are making dumb dosing choices that have the potential to backfire in the future.

Mystery of Evouchers,"

Hey all. Hopefully I used the right flair and am not asking a question that has already been solved. 

So, long story short I work on PAs all day for (mainly) GLPs. We also assist with copay cards, coupons etc. 

A weird thing I’ve noticed is the evouchers. They seem to have just popped up one day, automatically applied to some prescription and not others, for varying amounts. Sometimes the adjudication details will explain and sometimes not. 

In one instance I was trying to figure out why an evoucher was working with my pharmacy process software (Willow) but not at a retail chain. I called either Eli Lilly or Novo’s copay card helpdesk (don’t remember which) and they told me they have nothing to do with the evoucher (??) and its controlled directly through the processing software of each individual pharmacy (???). 

Another issue I’ve come across is the clashing between the evoucher and the actual copay cards. For instance, if I have a patient who has used all of the evoucher, and I try to use a copay card instead - I get a rejection that only one card can be used at a time. No idea how or if this can be overridden. I’ve heard Express Scripts and some other mail order pharmacies have disabled the evoucher all together but, how?

Can someone enlighten me on the mysterious ways of the GLPs evouchers? The world of GLPs is already dark and full of terrors. ",1727381285.0

RE: Vyvanse chewable,"No idea but that's not the point. You have data to support specific dosing requirements and you as a manufacturer can't just say ""yeah it's fine if you don't get the correct dose"", it's your requirement to do everything in your power to ensure the patient does get the correct dose as required under your license. If there is a risk for the patient not getting the correct dose the FDA isn't going to say ""ehhhhhhh that probably doesn't matter"" when you don't have clinical data to support it one way or another. Anytime there is knowledge by a manufacturer of someone taking off-label use you're still required to document everything to your PV team in case there ever is a adverse event. I can tell you when baci IV got its indication pulled for sepsis, everyone knew that it was being used off-label for surgical irrigation but that doesn't matter, you still weren't allowed to sell it in the US anymore or just relabel it for irrigation use without clinical trial data and full new NDA for the new indication to support it's use in irrigation even though you would assume there's no safety risk in doing so.",1726675210.0

One was Vyvanse chewable tablets already cut in half by the retail pharmacy they picked it up from. I read in the package insert to not take anything less than one chewable and a single dose cannot be divided. I can’t seem to find WHY though. If it’s simply because they don’t want patients cutting controls in half, or that it’s chewable and can break easily when cut, then I think it’s okay for the patient to take it as they have been taking it at home and it was cut by the retail pharmacy.

*FLORIDA* 12 Hour Board Approved Continuing Education Course In Laws And Rules,"?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=265d4cd358652c38f83d4eb36b3a589b151e9471

Hello all, as PIC I find myself in a position required to complete a ""twelve (12) hour board approved continuing education course in laws and rules"", as part of the Final Order in a case stemming from a failed FLBOP inspection. The above image is the only information I've been given, and so far I've found the following:

I've also been slapped with a pretty hefty fine, so I'm wondering if anybody knows of a more economical way to satisfy the CE requirement in the Final Order. I've found a number of free CE's that have a UAN ending in ""H03-P"", so I know they're specific to Pharmacy Law, but I suspect the wording ""board approved continuing education course in laws and rules"" stipulates a specific set of CE's that likely generates revenue for the provider/bop/doh etc., and so will be the only ones applicable.

Burn out,"I don't know how to link the post but yesterday I had made a post in this community voicing my frustration with retail pharmacy and the patients that give me a hard time from time to time who are taking a controlled medication and my confusion when they're on multiple controlled substances at once and how at times I question the legitimacy of the diagnosis and so on. I usually post in the technician community but I posted in here to A. vent and B. get a better understanding if there's something I'm missing based off my lack of schooling and short amount of time in this field. A lot of people shared their personal experiences with taking controlled medications and how it impacts their daily life and I really appreciated that so thank you if you took the time to do that. 

I honestly feel like I came off as a companionless judgmental asshole and that wasn't my intention at all. My store is not in a great area and a lot of times we are dealing with customers who are irate every time they come in. I've had a customer that I knew by name pull out a knife over a miscommunication over an oxycodone shortage. Do I automatically assume every person on oxycodone is the same as that person? No. Two things can be true at once. People can be on a cocktail of medications they do not necessarily need such as pain killers and people can be diagnosed with something such as ADHD and need Adderall to function. Doesn't mean I assume everyone taking adderall is a liar or everyone taking multiple controlled medications is a walking vegetable but yes there are a few that come in high and give us a hard time and it becomes draining. I love helping people and trying to make a difference in their life. I want to make their life easier if I can. I just feel I should be able to be frustrated from time to time in certain instances and talk about it. Are we all going to pretend it wasn't hard on us when the Ozempic epidemic hit and everyone and anyone was trying to get it and losing their mind when they couldn't because of shortages? Did every single person need it and use it for what it was made for? No and thats the point I was trying to get across. I dont want to be desensitized but some days it just weighs on me and seems that no matter how hard we try to help some of these people, we get the same response.

(E) For a non-controlled substance prescription, a pharmacist may change the dosage form, drug strength, drug quantity, and directions for use without consultation with and agreement of the prescriber or agent of the prescriber in accordance with the following:

(1) The drug selected must be the same drug indicated on the prescription;

(2) The drug selected must have the same frequency and duration of therapy as the drug indicated on the prescription;

(3) The prescription is for a human patient;

(4) No modifications shall be made pursuant to this paragraph if “dispense as written” or another phrase or indicator having a similar meaning is indicated on the prescription;

(5) The pharmacist who selects the drug to be dispensed pursuant to this paragraph shall assume the same responsibility for selecting the dispensed drug as would be incurred in filling a prescription for a drug using the prescribed form; and

(6) The pharmacist shall not substitute between long-acting and short-acting forms of the drug.",1727792010.0

I have respect for people that put the time and effort in to be the best they can for their career. Often times, it’s the people who have a little bit of imposter syndrome, or are self conscious, that grow to be extremely well rounded clinicians. 

It takes a certain level of self awareness to use that as motivation, but more often than not OP feels this way not because they think everyone around them is way better at their job, but that they’re worried about their patients health and truly care for their well being. That’s not saying the others don’t care, we all do. But someone who has these concerns and inwardly fights these concerns has a different level of empathy that isn’t able to be taught.

Looking for advice,"   Hello all! I’m a new pharmacist and I’ve found myself in an unusual situation. I was hoping to get some advice from pharmacists with some more experience. I apologize in advance for how long this is about to be.

   I graduated in 2023. The area where I live is very saturated with pharmacists (close to a pharmacy school), so it was a few hard months before I landed a full time position at a new independent pharmacy in the area. I was told in my interview that they have several other pharmacies, one and the same state and two in neighboring. I had several years experience working at different independents and APPEs in a few chains before I was a pharmacist, so I kind of thought I knew what to expect, but there’s some practices that I am very uncomfortable with.
   For starters the PIC is the wife of the owner. In my state this means she must work 30+ hours, however she doesn’t regularly work here (she lives in another state). She works 6 hours every couple of weeks. I also did some research and I believe that she is also the PIC of their pharmacy in the neighboring state (where she says she works per diem), which is also not allowed in my state.
In addition to the hours, there are some billing practices that recently came to light. My technician (the only technician) told me that the owner, manager, and PIC told her that she must NEVER reverse anything. Up until that point I thought that all filled prescriptions were being pulled, reversed, and RTS after 14 days. Turns out the entire bag is just being thrown in a box in the corner of the managers office. I also realized that the PIC (and the technician following her instructions) are signing for and marking prescriptions as picked up if they have not been picked up. This came to light when I realized that there were prescriptions marked as “picked up” that I could see never even had a label printed or were verified. There was one situation where we had an old, unfilled prescription for a Dexcom that the pt didn’t want and was filed, and months later the patient got a Freestyle Libre. This patient ended up leaving our pharmacy at the request of the owner because we were losing so much on the prescriptions. This was at least 1.5 months ago, and last week I came in and saw that the old Dexcom Rx sensor and reader prescriptions were reactivated, billed to insurance, and marked as picked up by the PIC. For a patient that isn’t even using our pharmacy anymore and is using Freestyle (and I’ve documented such on their profile).
   Theres also billing issues with NDCs, they want the most expensive NDC billed and the cheapest one dispensed. Sometimes this is brand/generic, sometimes it’s different manufacturers. I’ve haven’t been doing this but there’s been a lot of pushback about it, it’s brought in extra thousands of dollars from what I can see.
   There’s also non-pharmacy related issues. Like after an incident with our microwave where the fire department showed up, I realized we don’t have fire extinguishers anywhere. I texted the owner about this and he assured me that there are fire extinguishers near both exits and they were there for the inspection, but they’re nowhere to be found. I asked specifically where they are located and he told me that he’d “have to look”.
So when I started realizing all of the fraud that was happening, I did some research into their other pharmacies. I found a document basically saying their other pharmacy (and naming our PIC as their PIC in charge) had to pay over 100K in restitution to Medicaid for fraud. It listed the same practices/red flags that I’ve noticed here.
So I obviously don’t want my name attached to this, but I’m not sure what to do. Between my student loan payments and rent I really can’t afford to be unemployed for more than a month or so, but this area is SO saturated with pharmacists that I’m having trouble finding open positions even in big chain pharmacies within 50+ miles. I have gotten one interview with Rite Aid as a floater, but the pay is less than I would expect and I’m just concerned that if it doesn’t work out there and I end up leaving, my resume will make it seem like I’m not dependable. At the same time I’m worried that I’ll be responsible for what’s happening here even though I’m not the PIC.
   I’m trying to be a little vague because I’m not sure if anybody connected to this pharmacy will see this post, but I feel like the things happening here are so ridiculous it would be obvious anyway.
   I would appreciate any advice. I walked into this entire situation very naive and now I’m not sure what to do. My gut is saying to run but I’m worried about running to the first thing that’s available.

My best advice would be to always take care of yourself first, pass the phone onto another coworker, explain how the person is acting and threatening on the phone. Or even just hang up. Any decent boss will not stand for abuse and threatening customers, my head pharmacist will tell them they cant come back with that kind of behaviour.

RE: I don’t want to be a pharmacist anymore ,"Ok… I’ve read a lot of the comments so I’m going to ignore the part about why this situation is and tackle the ‘ What to do about it?’ Part

First, always be reading something that is either a review or something new that has come out.
Second, when you feel like you don’t know the exact answer, say “I just read something about that, let me make sure there’s not some new evidence that I need to look at first before giving you a answer.’

Third, then go look it up and get back with them.

Here’s the deal, nobody knows everything.  

There is space for you at this job if you make space.  That means finding your niche. What are you good at. Talking to the shy patiences, or talking to the difficult patients, or talking to the stubborn patients, or talking to children, or talking to geriatric patients.  

Your personality and way of thinking gives you an edge over others there.  Find it and and make sure someone that needs to know it, knows about your advantage.  It’s your job to declare your abilities so the team can work its best.  

True, there is a sense that most don’t care, or this is just a job, etc., etc.  but your self doubt isn’t going to just let it go… reframing the situation is your best shot at making this work.  

Shine when you can, … defer when you need a minute to check, and if anyone rolls their eyes or gives an annoyed feed back… remind them that even basic stuff can change in a moment.  And give them the example of several years ago when all of a sudden some patients can only have 3 grams of acetaminophen a day to avoid toxicity instead of the normal 4.  (Yeah, basic OTC toxic prevention got complicated overnight)

Have the attitude that they are being ridiculous… not you.  Yes efficiency is important, but safety and best outcomes is more important.  YOU are the better pharmacist by checking something you are not sure of… And being the best pharmacist you can be, is your job and not anything else.  

There is space for you…. Find it… Claim it.  … And eventually invite others in your space of professionalism and quality care.

You got this… ",1727811264.0

RE: Justification ,"If the Suboxone is routine and continued inpatient, it should be continued regardless. That oxy I’m assuming is for a short-term therapy?

However, if that prescriber is continuously prescribing oxy  even if it’s “PRN” outpatient, then they need to re-evaluate the medication assisted therapy for that Suboxone…

BZD taper issue with MD,"So, in the wonderful world of retail one of my longstanding patients started seeing a psychiatrist alongside his PCP. Patient has been on Xanax 1mg TID for over a decade. Is also on Fluoxetine. 

New psychiatrist randomly wants patient to hard stop Xanax and go to klonopin 1mg BID due to “shakiness”. Also prescribes sertraline 50mg and remeron 7.5mg. 

Patient didn’t understand how they were supposed to taper and was basically self tapering down to Xanax BID x4 days, then qAM the Xanax  and wanting to qHS 1mg klonopin for “weeks”.

Talked to the psychiatrist and was told that they were a doctor and they know what they’re doing (4 times at that) and at one point asked if I was a tech (I’m a pharmacist). Told me to take the patient’s Xanax from them when they pick up the Klonopin and that they would call the patient back and explain how they were supposed to just stop the Xanax and start the klonopin. I asked for notes or a fax or something indicating this tapering schedule and all holy hell broke loose because “I’ve never had to do that before, that’s ridiculous” and that they have their own notes in his chart about it. 

Patient is thoroughly confused, admits to me that he’s been taking the Xanax 1mg up to 5x day (he said he even told the new psychiatrist). Never received any documentation and the patient has almost a full Xanax Rx left that they recently picked up. Couldn’t in good conscience dispense the klonopin and the patient agreed to continue the Xanax for now. Also didn’t sell the new antidepressants because he likes his old ones and it’s a duplication of therapy. 

What would you do in this situation? From a safety and liability standpoint.

Micro-dosing Testosterone in a Single Dose World,"We have a ""nurse practitioner"" in town that on a few occasions  has prescribed micro-doses of testosterone to women. He will send over a quantity of 1 ml and directions of 0.01 ml intramuscularly (or subcutaneously depending on how he's feeling that day) twice a week for 91 days. These are, of course, billed through GoodRX and the patients expect the price of 1 vial.

What would you do? Would you dispense the 1 vial or 26 vials? I find it interesting that the box says specifically ""single dose"" and not ""single use,"" though maybe I am overthinking the semantics.

Honestly, I have gone both ways in the past with more normal doses (like 0.5 mls weekly). Sometimes I treat them as single use based on what the doctor sends over, or sometimes I run them as though the patient would reuse.

But this seems like a more egregious example of both the waste of giving multiple vials and the safety risk of using one vial.

Last time, I spent quite a bit of time explaining the possible risk of reusing the vial that many times even with a preservative, but she chose to just take one vial. Now she is back for a refill...one year later....

I'm leaning  towards running it for 1 ml and a 3 day supply. What she does with it once it leaves the pharmacy is up to her.

PA ordered dilaudid for a patient and seems like the argument was that he is not ""prescribing"" dilaudid to be dispensed, but rather is ""ordering"" one for inpatient use, so it should be okay for him to order CII med that is not hydrocodone. Basically saying the DEA/BNDD's definition on ""prescribing"" only applies to outpatient dispensing...

The argument by them was that ordering med to be given to the patient is prescribing; Even if inpatient use order is not considered prescription, the act of ordering med is still prescribing. 

I never had a CII order coming from PA or APRN during the overnight shift at this hospital and always was entered by MD or DO. CIII through CV, plenty from PA and APRN. As a retail pharmacist turned hospital pharmacist this year, I assumed the reason was because of the same reason as in retail setting.

Sure, some. Others don't remember to tie their shoes.

As you are just learning (OP), do what you can and get back to the patient. It may mean making a note in the communications diary or putting a note on the stock so it is kept for the patient for 72 hours (your working practices may vary).

Technically, you are ""getting it ready.""

A fax, a photo, an email is not a valid prescription. If you speak with the prescriber, you may get away with an emergency supply at the request of the prescriber (your local regulations may vary and not possible with a CD). 

In such a case with morphine, make the offer for the patient to get the hospital to fax (you don't know until you ask) as requested by the lead pharmacist. If they won't, then you should contact them yourself because of what it is and it is from the hospital. 

Such things as hospitals, controlled drugs, vulnerable patients, pregnancy, elderly, and paediatrics need a little more time and effort compared to normal patients. Remember this!

You just have to read the room and make that call. If they won't answer, leave a message log it in the PMR. As far as you are concerned, it becomes the hospitals problem. You could try again later if you aren't busy. I make a note for myself.

Learn that pharmacy is a game of tennis. You need to put the ball back in their court once you have it in yours.

90% of the pharmacy work is communication and how you convey the message. The patient isn't interested in the technical details. They just want their medication! But there are ways to say things.

Broke down at work today,"Hey all, I was just hoping to get some insight on this situation that happened at work today as I can’t stop overthinking about it. For context, I’m a student that has been working at said pharmacy for 2 years now.

A regular patient of ours (let’s call him Robert) called the pharmacy regarding an opioid script that he received when he got discharged from the hospital, and he sent a PHOTO of the script to my head pharmacist’s PERSONAL phone and was wanting to get it done. My head pharmacist replied to him that it needed to be emailed to our email, which he explained to me on call that he did not have email and that he could not physically come to the pharmacy to hand in the script. In Australia, it is illegal for pharmacists to dispense a medication, let alone a controlled substance based off a photo that the patient themselves sent, it needed to be sent by the prescribing doctor.

I would’ve asked the head pharmacist more about this situation, however he was in a meeting currently and the rest of the dispensary team was not aware of Robert’s situation. I put Robert on hold and asked the lead pharmacist at the time what the most viable option was, as us phoning the hospital was a bit unrealistic as we were understaffed and usually a very busy pharmacy (600+ scripts a day), plus we did not have access to any of Robert’s details or details on the script (meaning no hospital phone number for us to call). The lead pharmacist told me that Robert should call the hospital so that the prescribing doctor could fax the script to the pharmacy, so we can dispense it. I relayed this information to Robert, and he blew up at me.

He told me that he recently fell down a ladder and that he was in a lot of pain, let alone that he was a very busy man and that it was outrageous for us to ask him to call the doctor. He asked for my name so that he could make an official complaint about me, and that by the time that he comes down to the pharmacy if his medication isn’t ready “there will be a huge problem”. He proceeded to say that he’s been going to this pharmacy for 20+ years, and that it is ridiculous that we can’t do this for him (even though it would be illegal). I was left crying that I needed to be left alone for half an hour, and still had to push through the rest of the day.

I feel miserable at work,"Hello fellow nurses, I am not specifically seeking for advice although, if you have any, I'll take them into account. What I want the most is to vent (I put the ""rant"" flair because I didn't know which other would go along best with the post).

I am a 24yo nurse with 2 years of experience in administrative areas and outpatient departments (mainly). I am currently working in a developing country as the chief of an HIV/tuberculosis/hepatitis C program. It is my first job since I graduated and I've managed to do it fairly well and, most important (for me), to enjoy it. The infectology area has become a passion of mine thanks to this position but, lately, it has been taking a toll on my mental health and I'll explain the reasons.

First of all, I haven't been able to learn how to properly manage my emotions. I don't know if it has something to do with the diagnoses we treat in the program but the patients tend to have a VERY heavy emotional burden and it still affects me. On the other hand, the stablished dynamics of the program are quite strict on everyone (patients and healthcare workers), so it makes it a very tiring process; the patients gotta attend EVERY month of the year for the rest of their lives only to get their monthly antirretroviral and to tell the exact same things to the doctor. It also implies for us nurses, social workers and psychologists to run after the most difficult patients (which represent a good portion), having frequent consultations, calling them several times a month or even visiting them at their houses if they dont take their medication correctly or if they are at risk of abandoning the treatment. I understand that's something necessary until some extent, but as I told you, MANY of our patients are very conflicted and thus, conflictive, so it is incredibly exhausting to chase someone difficult without the proper resources to give them a holistic care. 

Other factor that is getting me tired of it all is the guilt-based system, in which, if those patients I told you about definitely don't want to take their medication properly, the healthcare system points the providers as the responsible ones. I am someone prone to feeling guilty easily so imagine carrying that extra emotional load. Another thing to mention is that my tuberculosis and hepatitis C cases have increased dramatically in the past year and I am feeling overwhelmed with the amount of work I'm having to do. I keep repeating to myself as a sort of mantra: ""it's not your fault, don't take it personally, it's only a job"", but I knew things were not good at all when I got a new wave of hepatitis C patients last week and all I could do was cry. I am currently going to psychotherapy twice a month and I'm progressively leaving my medication (I don't know if I left it at a bad time or if leaving them makes it seem like a bad time hehehe). 

Now, talking about a very important part of the whole thing; my salary. It is underwhelming to say the least. I work 48 hours per week monday to friday (plus two saturdays per month) and I know my efforts are not being proportionally compensated. It is one of the main reasons I feel frustrated. I believe I'll never reach economical security and, therefore, I'll never reach my dreams in general. I've been searching for countries to emigrate to; Spain and Brazil are my main options and I'm already working towards them, nonetheless, when I analyze the cost of living with the average nurse salary, I get so disappointed and go back to my previous thoughts. On top of that, my company decided not to increase the workers' salaries this year despite inflation and minimum wage increase (sadly, they are not obliged to do so by the law).

One of the things I gotta do at work (unofficially) is assisting the infectologist in their consultations. I gotta read the clinical histories, write the current clinical history and, over all, guide the infectologist in case they need extra information on the patient. This is one of the activities that gets me frustrated the MOST because I end up doing most of their job (which I shoudn't even be ""helping"" with in the first place). This infectologist never reads previous clinical histories, doesn't even ask for the patients' disease history and decides to do the most bizarre antirretroviral changes for the worst candidates. I've spoken up when I know their decision will affect the patient negatively but, most of the times, I get scolded even in front of the patients (which I consider as a type of professional insult). Don't get me wrong with what I will say next; I love being a nurse and I consciously chose this career but, with these salaries, the amount of work and the restrain I usually feel for not being able to do or say more in front of fellow doctors, I am considering studying medicine (have you ever considered that too when you feel overhwelmed at work?). I think I'd be very good at it but thinking of 10 more years of university and a huge debt isn't the best scenario.

I've been also considering the possibility of working in the US, since I've heard nurses there make a decent living (you guys will correct me if I'm wrong) and I have a good english level (btw, sorry for the mistakes I may have made throughout the whole text), but I havent looked through it deeply. 

Anyways, I hope this is just a bad moment that'll pass quickly. If not, at least I am considering alternatives. Thanks for reading the whole thing through. I'll be delighted to read your comments.

\*I just reread the whole post and I want to say that I LOVE my patients and I feel for them, maybe a bit too much. I don't want to come off as insensitive. Lately I've been feeling annoyed with things directly and indirectly related to them and it increases my feelings of guilt. I want what's best for them but not many times I wonder what's best for me.

I need to find something new before I have a mental breakdown ,"Hi all. I'm a medsurg neuro nurse, have been on this unit 3 years total (1 as a CNA, 2 as RN).

RE: Is it worth becoming a primary care NP first?,"Never insinuated anything, asked a question. You say the best care possible, yet are actively seeking advice on Reddit for a position that will account for the least patient interactions out of what I can only assume is fear of having to see multiple patients a day. 

Best care/safe care is irrelevant if you don't know what your doing. Doesn't matter if you see 1 patient a day or 20. As a new grad I can guarantee you, you won't have all the answers of knowledge for any specialty. It will take a lot of work, a lot of reps, a lot of independent learning and a team that is willing to teach you and mentor you. No job will start you out seeing 20-25 patients a day, at least none that I would take. 

I'm just saying seeking something with a less intense workload is a bad look as a provider, your docs will unlikely be seeing so few patients unless it's an over saturated practice or not very busy.

RE: SNF NPs? ,"You WILL be heavily pressured to not send patients out. So, be comfortable knowing when patients do and don't need to go out.

Things to consider: 
old people don't mount a wbc elevation as quickly to infection-- use clinical/secondary indicators of common infections to guide your gestalt and overall plan of care.


If you're getting a lot of pushback from the facility-- Talk to your attending if getting pushback, and fall back on their interpretation of facility doesn't agree with your plan of care. 

Don't sleep on tachycardia. Especially if infection is a concern. Old people have little reserve. They'll crump quick. If they have tachycardia, elevation in wbc, are altered even a little-- they need to go to the hospital. 

Understand cardio renal syndrome. A lot of times we end up failing to adequately diurese patients because we see an elevated creat in an obviously hypervolemic patient. So, we hold back on diuresing them, when in fact that is the one thing that will ultimately improve their chf and kidney function. 

Don't start z drugs or benzos on old people. Basically Ever. Excepting short course in the event of loss of spouse/close loved one. Even then, I wouldn't. You'll see a lot of people on simultaneous long term benzos and opioids. If that's the case, it is worth considering titration to DC of Benzo. But, it's hard.

Rather than focusing on the number of patients per day, I’d encourage you to look at things like mentorship, support, collegiality, work environment, culture, work life balance, benefits, etc. I’ve had jobs where I see 20 patients a day and feel great going home because the system and the people support me, and I’ve had jobs where I see 5 patients and feel totally frazzled and exhausted because everything is an uphill battle. The first year or two as an NP will be tough regardless, but choice of environment goes a long way towards making a job sustainable.",1726959898.0

New Grad RN - In need of guidance and support ,"I’m really in need of advice and support right now. I’m struggling in several areas of my life, and my anxiety is at an all-time high. As I go through my new grad residency, I often feel overwhelmed and underprepared. There’s so much to learn, and I feel like I don’t have the resources or support I need. I feel like I am dropping the ball, even though my patients frequently tell me I am the best nurse they've had. It’s incredibly difficult to stay on top of everything, especially when I can’t always rely on my nursing assistants and end up taking on extra tasks myself.

One of the biggest contributors to my anxiety is a charge nurse who seems to add to the pressure. Instead of offering guidance, she criticizes me for needing help or falling behind, making me feel like I’m failing rather than helping me through the challenges. Her presence turns already stressful situations into something I dread even more.

The stress has started affecting me physically—I’ve developed ulcers, and even on my days off, I can’t shake the anxiety and worry. I’m constantly afraid of making mistakes or missing something crucial. I’m really struggling to manage all of this and could use some guidance.

I’m not even scratching the surface of all the challenges I’ve been facing personally and professionally, and I am leaving out all details, but I feel burned out already, and I can’t afford to be. I feel scared and alone with my thoughts and worries, I wish I had the time and energy to explain my situation more thoroughly, but for the time being, I'm going to just put this out into the world and see if anyone can lend some guidance or support.

I’m sure this isn’t unique to NPs or nurses but curious if anyone here didn’t start this trend until after they became a nurse/NP.

I’m an ICU NP and some days I’m stretched so thin that I feel so needy for time alone after work. I don’t have a large family at home, just a loving husband and luckily he doesn’t mind. He knows my ritual. 

I don’t plan to completely eliminate it but I do want to explore other alternatives. Obviously exercise is gonna be the first suggestion. 😂

I know this is not an NP topic or really a rant but I wanted to see if there are NPs that can relate. 

Sometimes I feel lonely as a NP. We aren’t part of the nursing team anymore and we aren’t part of the doctor team. There may be other NPs in our department but it’s nothing like the collegiality of being an ICU NURSE, especially at nights. I miss those post shift breakfasts. I miss feeling like a team.

RE: Is it worth becoming a primary care NP first?,"Take this how you want but do you really want to be a provider? 

15 patients a day in any setting is not that many. 

I will confess, I am CC/Pulm and an AGACNP, I have never worked primary care but have several close friends in the setting. I work both inpatient and outpatient. When in clinic yes it's specialized, yes it's only a couple of problems you're addressing but you're addressing high complexity, higher acuity issues often. Even so, unless it's a new patient it's a 15 minute visit, so seeing 20-25 is very doable. 

My primary buddies see about the same, sometimes a few more and have great work life balance. 

I think the question you should be asking when looking for a job is what their structure is, do you get an MA/nurse? Are you getting RVU bonuses? Are you working independently or is it team care? How many new patients daily will you be expected to see? Is there a cap? If you're seeing 10 new ones daily and have 20 on the schedule it's gonna be rough, 1-5 not so bad. 

Deciding primary versus specialty for the sake of workload isn't the answer. You're gonna get worked and you're a new NP,  you're gonna be stressed, you're gonna have to study, your work isn't going to end at 5 like everyone else, your documentation is gonna be weak at first, and slow.

RE: Worried about New policy,"I’m a travel ER RN. 

I first saw this implemented about 10ish years ago - and it’s spread a lot since then. I would say most of the hospitals I end up at now do this method. 

Is it ideal? Absolutely not. But it’s a cost saving measure to the hospital. 

Especially in the ER where we’re constantly getting bombarded. They found a lot of patients were sitting for hours in the ER just waiting for report to be given. Not because either nurse didn’t want report - but because our ratios are already dangerous. It doesn’t matter if we have 5 patients. See that spot under the clock? They’re gonna put a stretcher there and give you patient 9/10. Oh and that spot beside the bathroom? Patient 11/12. Some hospital systems don’t even have enough stretchers and just line chairs up in hallways. Cancer, sepsis, whatever - you get a chair and the nurse gets to have a back injury from having to squat and do IVs on the fucking ground. 

As an ER nurse I do appreciate this system a little more because I hate seeing patients sit down there for hours. They want to get upstairs get comfortable and go to bed. Statistically every hour an admitted patient stays in the ER increases mortality rates. 

This is just another jenga tile being pulled from our healthcare system safety net. This is what happens when we have business people running healthcare. They see numbers, not people. Safety events are not in their minds, just the almighty profitable dollar. 

The worst part is at every hospital system I’ve been at - any nurse that complains or makes a complaint about this ends up getting targeted and management weeds them out. It happens everywhere. The squeaky nurse gets the axe. The actual advocates for safety and concern of the patients - were the “bad” ones for not just blindly accepting this bullshit system. 

As far as patient numbers - I can’t tell you the last time I had under 6 patients. Pre pandemic? And they really do not give a shit. I got a AAA in one bed and less than 20 minutes later a full trauma in the bed beside it. I wish I could say this was a one time thing - but this kind of thing happens to me everywhere I go. It’s the new “culture”. 

They don’t care. Nobody cares. We’ve been bitching about this for years. Until the public starts making a fuss about it we won’t see change. 

I literally called state representatives at one hospital because they were literally killing people with their awful ratios. Nothing. “Well they can’t afford nurses”. Really? The hospital that profited over a billion dollars during the pandemic can’t afford nurses?? I told their state rep that I hope they get to experience the care first hand after they or a family member becomes ill/injured. 

Nurses - we’re the scapegoat of healthcare. It’s why we’re seeing huge mass exodus from bedside. It’s not going to get better any time soon either. None of our “organizations” do anything to advocate for us and keep our profession safe. They’re so busy writing stupid content on how to not get sued or how to align your chakras bullshit instead of lobbying to change our profession. Fine hospitals that go over ratios, post it on a state website, have it listed for everyone to see so they know they are getting shitty care because the hospital will not pay a decent wage nor treat their workers with dignity.

The next gen of nurses coming though - they’re gonna FAFO on that one because they do not give a shit. The social contract is broken. They can go to another hospital or another city or another company and have no problems walking out the door. I hope this is what actually unfucks us. But after almost 20 years I’m not holding my breath on that.",1727876374.0
RE: When do you work a patient in? ,"Is this primary care? Does your clinic have nurses? If so, have a nurse triage the latecomer and decide based on that. One clinic I worked at had two same day slots for the NP each day. One in the morning and one in the afternoon. Unless there was an emergent issue, they could be added to that slot and wait or come back. 

For visits that can wait, your clinic staff need to reschedule them and if patients are being unruly about it, management needs to step in and deal with them. Your day should not be taken up managing scheduling issues due to things like sick colleagues or routine latecomers.

Disciplinary Options	,"Hey all, I’m posting this on behalf of my friend who does not use Reddit, but is needing some insight on a situation. 

Today, my friend received a call from the state board stating that an anonymous complaint had been filed stating that this nurse bragged about using marijuana, cocaine, and ecstasy and using fake urine to get around drug tests. There were also claims that this nurse frequently bad mouths patient family members, calling them stupid, incapable, etc. They gave the nurse three options: surrender the license, start an investigation, or enter into the state board of nursing’s drug rehabilitation program. The nurse does use marijuana on occasion and used the other substances while on a 2 week vacation earlier this year, but has not used them since. The claims about bad mouthing patient family members are false. We believe this is an attempt at retaliation since the nurse walked out of a job earlier this year after an unsafe situation occurred during their shift. They have gotten other jobs since then that required drug tests and passed them. 

What would you do? Is it in their best interest to get a lawyer?

Personal post after dealing with the recent death of my brother.,"Ok, This is gonna be a long one… sorry guys!!

I’m an ER nurse, I have been one for twenty years. I’ve worked critical access, level 1 and all in between. I’ve traveled and worked in 9 different states. I have experience and certs but none of that matters when it comes to how I actually treat human beings every single shift. Last week, actually 12 days ago, my brother, a known addict passed away from an overdose. He’s battled addiction off and on for nearly 15 years. He had just got out of jail after 6 months for a probation violation and died 2 days later. For nearly a week we had been trying to locate him. The night he OD’d his girlfriend (also an addict) called 911, gave CPR until medics got there and transported him to one of the local hospitals where he was pronounced DOA. His girlfriend attempted to call the hospital multiple times. She said he was brought there and he didn’t have an ID but she wanted to give them his name and info so that we (his family) could be contacted to come get his body released. The hospital claims they took the info from her and would relay it to the doctors and nurses. He was tagged as an “unknownID” in the morgue and left there for 3 days. Not only did she call but I called, my mom and his daughter (who’s 22 years old) called to attempt to give info, I described tattoos, approx height/weight, eye color, etc. I was told to call the coroner by the hospital. The storms came through over the past weekend and ravaged the south as well as overwhelmed hospitals but by the time the storms hit, my brother had been dead for nearly 6 days. Once I called the coroner they told me that they did have an unknown male fitting his description sent to the crime lab for processing so I needed to call them. So yet another call made in an attempt to ID my brother. I gave the crime lab name, birthday, tattoos, etc etc. At this point he’s been dead 10 days. Finally this morning I get a call saying “based on your description we have your brother, but since the hospital mismanaged his info and did not make any attempt to properly ID him we have to wait on fingerprint analysis to formally ID and we will release him” Ok fine. But here we are at day 12 unable to put my brother to rest bc the nurse that took the call from his gf didn’t bother to ID him, or call the police or anyone in fact. He was treated as another junkie. I get that we see it so much we become desensitized to it…. But they’re still human beings, they still have family that love and care for them and my mom is a complete and utter mess bc she can’t put her baby boy to rest over one mishap that led to a long and crazy chain of events that had his body misidentified multiple times prior to my call to the crime lab. 
Does anyone know if there’s any Avenue I can take to see if this hospital follows the proper chain of command after a person is pronounced dead but unidentified? I know that every ER I’ve been to when we get John does in traumas or ODs we call detectives or local patrol to inform them so in case any missing person report comes in or a loved one tries to call we can at least get the deceased identified in a timely manner so the family can grieve. The only reason we knew it was probably my brother is bc of the gf informing us the night of the OD and then 4 days after his OD and multiple calls to the hospital his daughter went to the police to file a missing persons report and they were able to pull the police report by the officer who responded to the call with EMTs and low and behold my brothers name and birthday as well as multiple ways to ID him and several phone numbers to call were listed in the report. It even says the officer gave the EMTs his name and birthday prior to loading him on the ambulance. I get with no formal ID the hospital labeled him unknown….but why after multiple calls that night and the day after were we told “we don’t have record of your brother being here, sorry, call the coroner” His body has been to 3 different morgues at this point. I was told this morning by a detective that if the hospital would have at least taken the info the gf gave, called me or my mom, that we could have went to the hospital, visually ID’d him and then he would have gone to the crime lab for processing no more than 1-2 days. It could still be another 1-3 days before we can get my brother. All of the paperwork has to be done over again under the proper name so toxicology gets processed correctly, and so on. I’ve never been so emotionally exhausted in my life. One nurse could’ve saved us over a weeks worth of time had she bothered to make a phone call. I feel sick. Is this how we treat people now? I know I don’t. I even went to work during the storm, we had hundreds of patients crowded in our 45 bed ER, several unknown traumas and ODs and none of them left the rooms until we made calls to try to ID them. I just don’t think I could ever put a family through this much pain. Can I reach out to the hospital and try to have them provide education to ED nurses about the importance of getting all the info you can? Is there anything I can do so another family doesn’t go through what we’re going through? 

Sorry for the book. My mind is in overdrive. I’m sickened and exhausted. I just want to get my big brother home. 💔",1727821950.0

RE: Worried about New policy,"In med surg it is a nightmare.  Often I get a call from the ED giving report when I didn't even know a patient was coming. That's fine, I get to review with the nurse. 

But to have a pt just show up on the unit? When I already have 4 or 5 patients? That's tough. (If they're doing the 10 min thing I would usually be in a patients room, wound care, starting IV's, code browns, assisting to bathroom etc etc)
When the patient gets there now I have.to dig, did the X problem get treated? New labs? Doc notified? Pain treated? Again, I have 5 other patients.

In my 25+ years I've sent rew admits to icu several times. It is very time consuming.  And unsafe for not only the new patients but for my existing patients as well. 

And honestly, there have been many many instances where the unit and nurses didn't even know the patient was in the room. Sometimes for hours. I've walked.by my room and said ""Hi! When did you get here?"" This has happened with and without ED.phone report.

RE: This was worth a chuckle. ,"The legendary internet troll Kung Fu girl made a post about this exact same scenario about 10 years ago. She applied for a position, her male interviewer talked down to her, offered a lower salary than normal, and she passed on it. 

Fast forward a week, and the job was reposted with a higher salary. She called them back, asked to speak directly to the doctor (fortunately, she was able to, not having to go through the hiring office), told him she was available, and got the job & higher salary on the spot.

She taunted the hiring office guy mercilessly every day by reminding him of what he tried to do (as if to say, ""Bish, I know you tried to screw me over.""), laughing about it in front of him, and spoke to him authoritatively, reminding him that she knew she was better than him, every chance she got. It pissed him off, and he sent the post forwarding a subpoena to her. Turned out, the subpoena was likely fake, but the botch probably didn't get fired.

New grade nurse who feels like a bad advocate,"Hey everyone, I am a new grad nurse who has been working for exactly 2 months. For the most part, my floor is full of people who are are medically stable and need placement to TCU/rehab, or need wound cares or IV antibiotics. Patients typically stay on this floor for a couple weeks. There is one patient, however, who I think is very, very sick. I got home from my shift last night, and all of these things popped into my head of how I could have cared for her better.

She only weighs about 80 pounds and is severely malnourished. She was admitted to the ICU with DKA from undiagnosed diabetes and had all sorts of electrolyte imbalances. Alert and oriented, but has mental capacity of a 14 year old. She developed an unstageable sacral pressure injury from her time in the ICU, I was in her room constantly to check on her and reposition her. Has bilateral nephrostomies from hydronephrosis. She is on nocturnal tube feedings to help with malnourishment, but she does not tolerate them well. I held it last night after she had two spells of diarrhea even after loperamide/banatrol were given. I don't think she actually absorbs any of the feed, and the diarrhea freaked me out because it gets so close to her sacral wound dressing. I paged the doctor and he concurred with the decision, day shift is supposed to work with dieticians to get her NOC feed re-evaluated. Also straight cathed her for a UA sample because I suspected a UTI, UA showed bacteria, culture is underway now. I also called a rapid because her SBP parameters were >90, and the highest I got was 89. Her SBP bounced back up without intervention, and RRT said just to check her blood pressure/MAP more frequently overnight. No sepsis suspected per their assessment. I did more frequent vitals on her, and her heartrate and blood pressure were baseline, and her slight fever disappeared without giving Tylenol throughout the night. 

An order came in overnight for calcium gluconate around midnight. I messaged the doctor because I didn't understand why it was ordered. He wrote back and said ""for hypotension."" For a second, this made sense. But after inquiring further, I realized he meant to order it for a pt on an entirely different unit. So I never gave it, and the order was discontinued. Pt is on Mg protocol for hypomagnesemia. Ran the protocol at shift change once the lab result came in, and her Mg was 1.2. I ordered Mg sulfate for her per protocol orders, but I am now convinced that if I had given the calcium gluconate, she would have died or severely declined. Calcium drives Mg down, doesn't it? Glad I questioned the order regardless. 

Anyway, I am just beating myself up because I am still learning how to advocate for patients, and this is the sickest pt I have ever had. I know I did some things right. But when I got home, I started wondering, ""if this pt is malnourished, why doesn't she have full electrolyte work-up. Why just magnesium? What is causing the malabsorption all of the sudden? Shouldn't she be on telemetry?"" (pt is chronically tachycardic (110), cardiac assessment was otherwise normal, but I am still concerned about possible electrolyte changes.

""I wish I had stopped the tube feeding the night before when she had diarrhea too, because that contributed to electrolyte imbalances, and her diet order should have been changed sooner."" Her diarrhea was previously controlled with loperamide in the last unit she was in, so I am not sure why it stopped working for her. She did not have any more BMs after the feed stopped, so I think the feed was definitely the problem. 

I did the best I could considering I had 5 other patients, but I wish I had thought to do more. I ask for help and ask questions when they come to me on the floor, but these thoughts came to me once I got home, and it is tearing me up a bit. It was an absolutely crazy couple nights, but I wish I was a better advocate, especially when she has so much going on. Even if I don't have her again, I want to check-in to see if any of her cares change and suggest what I can. Please let me know what you think.",1727802390.0

I gave them a juice at the end and asked for a high five for being so brave, instead of smacking my palm, they grabbed me around the waist and gave me the biggest hug they had and said thank you. I do believe that’s one of the best patient reviews I’ve ever gotten. Made my whole damn day.

Well it got off orientation and they came back weeks later and I was assigned to work with them again. I explained to my charge that this pt had previously 'fired' me from their care. I was told it would be OK. This pt hasn't outright been mean, but they have been passive agressive with an attitude. They asked for someone else to do a self explanatory procedure they needed done and cut me off when I was telling them the plan for the day to demand water. Will pretend to sleep when i ask questions. I forgot to grab a 2x2 for one of the cares they needed and they got upset, I said ok I will go grab it and then they proceeded to argue with me about exactly what I was going to grab, they thought I was grabbing the wrong thing. There is a noticeable difference from when the pt is talking to me vs the other nurse that came in to do the procedure that pt requested I didn't do. This nurse had also never done the skill and told them so. They are very unpleasant to work with and it is difficult to do pt care when they think you are incompetent.

Half the time I know they don’t give a shit about the result, but I have to message them and chart that I did or I risk losing my job. And god forbid something happened and I didn’t message to avoid bothering them!

My second week off orientation, I had a pt who’s systolic was in the 170’s. There was an order to notify for over 180. Also had a prn med for systolic over 180 that had been given on previous shifts occasionally. I charted it the bp as well as a comment that the order states to notify if >180 systolic and no meds ordered for under that.

Next morning night shift nurse acted like I was an idiot for not messaging the doctor because when she went to do vitals, the systolic was up to 184. Told me I was in the wrong and should’ve messaged and it wouldn’t have gotten that high… shut her up real quick when I pulled up the orders of when to notify for that specific patient and mentioned that I couldn’t give any meds since it was under the parameter 🙄 was glad I’d charted it to cover myself.

"RE: If you're looking for a ""cush"" job, please stay out of IR.","Can confirm.  I currently work at a cardiology clinic and am responsible for 3 providers, so all their calls and pt messages.  I am also expected to check pts out of the clinic as well - order Rx changes, testing, schedule procedures, etc. on top of that, I have to do nurse visits/wound checks for patients post procedure or if they have concerns. Meanwhile I'm working on queuing up surgical clearance forms, med refills, calling results, and fighting insurance denials on meds and testing and dealing with incoming alerts from heart monitor studies or implanted devices.  On a good day I dont also have to go start IVs for the echo dept next door and do bubble studies. 

I actually like it because I've always enjoyed the education part of nursing and having some autonomy on my own, and having a close working relationship with patients and providers where I learn new stuff everyday.  I came from ICU and had no idea about the other parts of cardiology that take place in the outpatient world.  It's honestly made me a better nurse, critical thinker, and clinician. Our clinic is a bit different though - admittedly, we are very nurse heavy.

I used to hear people say they'd be too bored working in a clinic but I can promise that is very far from the truth.  I am a slave to a computer and phone and rarely even get a chance to get out of my chair, and if someone calls out or is off (we work four days a week) then I have to take on their inbasket and providers too.

RE: When do you work a patient in? ,"This one is probably an unpopular opinion (based on what I've read), but with my client population when I was still working primary care, I tried to see all of them, regardless of when they showed up. I had a more of a complex/vulnerable population, and part of working with that group was attempting to reach them where they were at, and that included making allowances for late appointments and no-shows. 

With that being said, I was the only person in my clinic who did that, and it was an expectation that I put *on myself* because that was the type of care I wanted to provide. This was also the type of population who will reach out for an STI treatment, for example, and if turned away, will never be seen again. In that case, it was important to me to be able to provide that. 

However. If that was an expectation that was put on me by management, I would have felt differently, and if I hadn't been able to build my day around that time, it probably wouldn't have been manageable, either. It did, however, work very well for that particular community.",1727150023.0

RE: Is NP worth it? ,"1000% agree with this. The mid-level field is so overly saturated with 1) nurses who don’t have enough bedside experience, and 2) people who don’t really know what they want to do with their careers and went just because. As a bedside nurse I make more than the NPs who work in the hospital, but I also live in a high nursing pay state.

OP - diversify your bedside experience, go to other hospitals, other units. Learn from experienced nurses! Give yourself time, then decide if YOU are ready to make serious decisions about someone’s chronic illness/medication regimen, or if you have the diagnostic/assessment skills necessary to, for example, catch a cancer early. In my seven years in ER, I’ve had so many patients and friends who got pushed around by their mid level from specialty to specialty and ended up with a late stage cancer diagnosis or a missed heart failure because their NP/PA just didn’t know what to do with them. This is dangerous and potentially life-threatening/ending. Forget about the money and instead do some reflection on whether or not you have the skills necessary to essentially function like a doctor (who has typically a decade+ of medical training). That’s how NPs/PAs are expected to think and function in our current healthcare system, and it’s not sustainable or safe. Not to mention the NP online school mills are making thousands and thousands off people because there’s basically no vetting like there is at “brick and mortar” universities and colleges. 

You have plenty of time to decide. I just left my ER job to do PICU at a large research/academic facility. Who knows what I’ll do after that. Point is, we have so many options of places to go as bedside nurses - take advantage of it before you board the NP train.

We truly had patients who had waited for a bed for 8 hours post surgery. The bed is assigned, the room is clean! Amazing. 

Except it’s 2000 and I call to give report. 

“Their nurse is giving meds. They will call you back as soon as possible”

It’s 2100: “the nurse is on break. They’ll be back in 10 minutes and will call you back”


2130: “the nurse isn’t back from break yet. No, there isn’t a nurse available to take report for them”


2145: I give report to the charge after calling the AOD. The OR is on hold, and we will now have to call an on call person in. 


We actually did a study about patient delay because of this seemingly frequent issue (we all would have to do a safety report for when this happened). We tracked times: wait for bed assignment. Wait for report. Who we contacted and how often we contacted them. In 60% of the cases, patients were waiting for over 3 hours with a ready bed on the floor and this led to significant delays for the OR. That’s pretty ridiculous.

It isn’t talked about enough how difficult the switch is. Just know you are NOT alone. Most new nurses have felt the same way you have including me. My best advice is to take this job one day at a time and do your best. Nursing is a 24/7 job and if there are things that aren’t done it is ok! We’re all doing our best for our patients. Another piece of advice is try to find something on your off days to turn your nurse brain off. For example I like taking a walk and hanging out with my dog. 
On the other hand the charge nurse that you’re describing seems like such a bully who embodies the “nurses eat their young” attitude and that is not ok. My best advice to navigate that is to find other nurses on the unit that you can turn to first in times you have questions or needs and if that doesn’t work go up the chain of command with your concerns. If you have tried everything to make it work and it seems like it’s not - change your job, find a different unit or facility to work in. The nice thing about having an RN license is that there’s so many avenues to go down, you just need to find the one that works for you!

Traumatized Baby nurse with ADHD verbally attacked by belligerent type A nurses aid,"I'm using a throwaway account because I've mostly retired from Reddit, but I really need to vent in a niche space. I know I’m a mess, and criticism is valid, but just know I’m already beating myself up a lot over this.

I’m a fairly new LPN graduate with less than six months of experience in my current job. I work in a massive long-term care (LTC) facility that primarily serves dementia patients, but we also have residents with severe mental illness, traumatic brain injuries, bariatric needs, respiratory issues, and neurodegenerative disorders. Yes, I was warned not to take jobs with big sign-on bonuses, but I needed the money. I don’t regret my decision, but today was hell.

To set the scene: there isn’t much hierarchy at my workplace, which I appreciate. I dislike the power dynamics in acute care, especially as an LPN with ADHD (no offense to my acute care friends). At my facility, LPNs and CNAs work as equals on the floor, and the RNs are generally approachable. The reason I’m mentioning this is because we have a lot of vocal CNAs. I don’t mind this; I actually feel comfortable asking them questions, especially as a new hire, since many of them have tons of experience. However, there’s one CNA in particular who seems to have lingering resentment toward me and how I do things, and today that tension boiled over.

When I started, I got a pretty half-hearted orientation. After a medication error and going to my manager with my anxiety, my orientation was extended for a few weeks (I’ve talked to two other new hires who had similar experiences). The CNA in question worked with me during my extended orientation and seemed annoyed that I didn’t have the same workload as everyone else. She cornered me and grilled me for several minutes about why I was still orienting, implying that I’d been doing it for an “awfully long time.” I gave her vague answers because it wasn’t her business, and honestly, I just didn’t want to engage.

Another time, she chastised me about a personal change to my appearance, questioning why I did it and saying she didn’t know how she felt about it. There was also an incident where I was short-staffed, covering for another LPN and doing twice the tasks I normally would. She came into a patient’s room while I was working, scolded me for how long I was taking, and even sat down in the room, piling on guilt. I calmly told her, “I have extra work to do, and I’ll be up as soon as I’m ready.” My pace didn’t affect her tasks in any way, but she persisted in making me feel inadequate. I reported her behavior to the RN on duty, and she backed off for a while, becoming nicer, and I thought she’d finally stopped obsessing over my every move. During all these interactions, I made an effort to be kind.

Today, however, everything came crashing down. I was working with her again and didn’t think much of it at first. At one point, I went to take my break. She was in a cozy room we have on the unit (not on break), talking on the phone, in which wasn’t an official language of our country. I know from experience that she talks to friends or family during work (she later claimed she was speaking with a government agency, but I’d seen her do this before). I asked if she’d mind if I took my break in the room, given she was having a casual conversation(she was also not on break and therefore suppossed to be on the floor). She waved her hand without looking up, and I interpreted it as her telling me to leave, though looking back, she might have been gesturing for me to sit down. Either way, everything she does feels passive-aggressive and condescending.

Frustrated, I shook my head, turned to leave, and said, “You don’t like me.” When I returned from the vending machine, she started yelling at me in front of staff and residents. I desperately tried to usher her into a quieter space to keep things professional. She followed me, still raising her voice, claiming she was on the phone with a government agency. I matched her volume slightly, repeating, “You don’t like me,” and counteracting her other accusations of me while trying to lead her to a more private area.

Once behind closed doors, she lost it. She yelled, criticized me, and when I told her she didn’t know what I was going through, she responded that she didn’t care. I was in full-blown fight-or-flight mode. I was shaking, heart racing, flushed. Embarrassed that I’d matched her volume up until then, I forced myself to sit down. She demanded, “Who do you think you are?” I responded, speaking more calmly now and in a normal volume, “I think I’m a good person.” That made her even angrier. I told her this was unprofessional and that I was supposed to be on my break. She, again, said she didn’t care and kept yelling, getting in my face. I asked her to leave, pointing out that she was spitting when she talked, and as she left, she called me lazy , her phone call was more important then me and closed the door behind her so I could panic and have the rest of my break.

 I understand how frustrating it can be for experienced staff when new employees seem to struggle. But every nurse who has trained me has emphasized protecting my license above all else. CNAs here often rush nurses to cut corners and finish meds early  to prioritize care, but that doesn’t make you a good nurse, and it doesn’t keep patients safe. I also have ADHD and PTSD, which makes me more prone to distraction, so I double and triple check my work especially since i'm a float nurse. I’m now seeking therapy through work to manage this, but my mental health has been worse lately, partly because I’m dealing with reporting a historical sexual assault to the police, which isn’t going well. My manager knows I’m struggling mentally and has been supportive.

I regret raising my voice and matching her energy. I usually handle intense patient situations well, but verbal abuse from certain people triggers my PTSD. I’m fully aware that I am responsible for my own behavior, and I wish others thought that way too. I’ve lost jobs due to my disability before, so I know the stakes, and I’m nervous. I want to report her to HR because this has gone on too long, but I’m worried I’ll incriminate myself as well. Part of me thinks I should just be honest and admit I messed up, but also explain the history of her behavior. What do you guys think?

Thanks for letting me vent. I refuse to be spoken to like this again. I’ve dealt with workplace bullying , harassment and assult in the past, and I won’t let it become part of my career again. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

P.S. I was so stressed at the end of my shift that I forgot to do my narcotics count and accidentally took the keys with me right after we had a meeting about it. I’ve never done that before. Like I just left , someone said they here here now and I bounced not even thinking. I don't know where my brain was at. The RN on shift scolded me when I brought them back. I feel paralyzed with anxiety and shame and am afraid i'll be reported for that too. What a day.",1727842554.0

ICU or IR?,"Hello all, struggling with making a decision and would love to hear others’ thoughts. Nursing is a second career for me. I’ve been working in a specialty ICU for the last 1 year 8 months (my entire nursing career) and in IR for the last 6 months. 
I’ve been getting pretty burnt out in the ICU job because we are required to rotate between day and night shift, and it’s really impacting my health and ability to sleep. I love the patient population and I enjoy bedside but the schedule has been eating away at me. 
Some of the nurses there are not very supportive and some can be very demeaning when I ask questions - I feel judged for asking a lot of times. There’s also a heavy culture of gossip and favoritism from management. I used to work in this sort of environment in a previous career so I can handle it, it just is sad to me. 

I started working in IR as a PRN and I’ve really enjoyed it. Granted, it can feel a little repetitive compared to bedside but the people I work with are fantastic. There is a sense of community and care between coworkers. 
I was offered a FT position in IR but I’m torn on whether to take it or not. I want to stay in the ICU and I love that specialty, but I doubt they would let me go PRN there. There aren’t any hospitals within an hour drive that offer days only. There is one that is an hour and ten minutes away but that is too far for me, given the commute I already do. 

I also plan on moving states in the next 6 mo-1 year. 
Do I stay FT with the ICU, PRN with IR and manage the fatigue best I can? 

Or go FT with IR, work on my health until I move, and ask in hopes that my ICU job lets me go PRN? I plan on looking for an ICU job in the next state I move to.

Kind of down because of my patient social dynamics,"I have known this patient for about 2 years now. Our relationship started when I was taking care of him and tried to get him to transition to comfort care. 

It's a very sad situation because he had an accident that led to all these complications that our ultimately life limiting. 

He has spent more time in the last 2 years in the hospital than home. If he discharges to SNF he leaves AMA goes home for 1-2 days and is right back to the ER and then transferred to my hospital. He always comes back to my service because its all related to his initial injury. He's had so many surgeries trying to patch and plug holes, and he's noncompliant with treatment recommendations so no wonder why it always fails.

Well last Friday I finally told the pt we were out of options and he would never leave the hospital to go home. He seemed shocked even though I've been having this conversation for about 2 years it feels like. I'm assuming it's more denial. He tried to be wishy washy but we set boundaries let him know anything further was medically futile but offered to keep him comfortable until he transitioned fully to hospice. 

In this time his wife has had minimal interaction with him due to her drug habits, she's highly volatile. He has 2 children that are estranged and grandchildren that are estranged. When I had to get a surrogate decision maker from him he appointed a friend that he's known for 4 years from a community club. They aren't close but the friend was willing to be there knowing this guy had NO ONE else.

In the 2 years this patient has been verbally and physically abusive to staff, banned from almost all of the area SNF and IPR facilities. There's no where he could go. 

I went to visit him today to see how he was at the hospice house he went to. Since he's been there about 24 hours his wife has had verbal altercations with the staff, he's had the guy from the club visit once, and he's now hopefully moving towards actively dying and is no longer responsive. 

Idk if his nurse was lying to me to try to make me feel better but he told me the patient asked about me today. I am nobody to this patient, or at least I should be in the grand scheme of things. It about broke me. Just sadness I feel for him to be dying alone and he has no one because of the person he's been, because of how he's chosen to live his life.

I called my 1 daughter on the way home and reminded her how much I love her and how it would literally kill me if she ever tried to not have a relationship with me. I tell my other 2 kids the same things. I make sure I tell them how much i love them, how important they are, how much I need them.

RE: ALMOST GAVE WRONG MED!!,"Always utilizing patient medication administration rights prevents med errors from occurring because ""To err is human...""

Where was your preceptor when the medications were being pulled and administered? Are you close to being on your own and patients were split between you two? There is no justification for her screaming at you. That disturbs me. Facilities should have mentor programs in place to teach and guide people on how to handle that role professionally. They should also pay mentors more for the added responsibilities. 

I wish seasoned nurses realized that eating our young is not only a disservice to the new nurse but to themselves as well. We're already understaffed and overworked. Why run off new nurses that relieve some of that burden? This is a perfect example of why nurses don't want to self-report errors!

She missed the boat on a critical teaching moment. Don't let her inappropriate response prevent you from self-reporting any future errors.

You learned a valuable lesson to always utilize patient medication rights for every patient, every time, and to always listen to your patients no matter their age. Most of them know what they're on and what those meds look like too.

RE: Start my new job next month!,"You need to take extreme caution with doing this. You're now working with a higher license. If you continue working as an RN while also working as an APRN in the same health system, you will open yourself up to litigation. 

Example: you have a crashing patient come into the ED who requires pressors and a CVC, as an APRN, you can perform the procedure and order the drugs. As an RN, you have to report your findings to the appropriate provider who can complete the tasks. The patient dies, and you're called in for a deposition. The first question asked will be: you're credentialed through the health system to perform these tasks, and now you've delayed care, causing the death of the patient. 

No hospital in the US would ever protect you. At the end of the day, the hospital will always protect itself and cut off whatever weight it needs in order to protect itself.

RE: Personal post after dealing with the recent death of my brother.,"Of course, most places have unknowns labeled differently. My biggest thing is, if someone calls and gives you a name and attempts to ID them by description/markings, why not call a supervisor or whoever your hospital designates to handle unknown patients and have them call a person back. I left my info (so did my niece and my mother) and said if they had any unknown white males that fit his description that had come in DOA or otherwise, to please call and I can follow their policy on getting a formal ID. For nearly 24 hours we were given the run around, one time i was even transferred to their morgue and left a message but still, nothing. After 3 days the coroner picked him up. When I called the 3rd day and finally got an answer the hospital said “yes we had a white male that fits your description but he was picked up by the coroner earlier” so basically he had been there all along. For 3 days we held onto hope that he was possibly alive. Then the storms started and the coroners office was only open to respond to body pick up calls so I went several more days holding onto hope. The not knowing part was harder than finding out it was really him. I too understand that there can be mixups, especially this day and age with so many ODs happening daily. But this really opened my eyes to how pertinent it is to make all attempts and exhaust every avenue to ID a John or Jane Doe prior to them leaving your care. I had 2 unknowns myself during the storm over the weekend, I went to work even with all this going on to help the community get through a storm we didn’t prepare for. I managed to get one ID’d in the ED after calling in detectives who recognized the patient from prior run ins and gang related things. The other unknown I called the authorities to report him after we pronounced as he came in from a homeless camp with no ID as an OD. The police took over on him and even called homicide detectives to ask the next steps. He was later taken by the coroner to the crime lab to be fingerprinted so they could attempt an ID.

The patient case that nearly sent me to our psych ward this morning,"Hi - nightshift ED RN here. I’ll keep it short. This story isn’t for the weak. 

A patient (elderly male from NH w/ PMH of advanced dementia) needed an external male purewick. I set the suction canister and tubing up, when suddenly the dumbest most featherbrained tech in my ED pops into the patient’s room and offers to help me. Let’s call her Rachel. I said, “no girl, it’s alright, I got it.” Rachel, as sweetly as can be, says, “No, let me help!” and proceeded to swiftly glove up and expose the patient’s penis. 

To my horror, the glans and the shaft were absolutely caked in smegma and yeast. It was crusted on and around the glans and also up the shaft as a thick milky film - think kiefer mixed with pieces of yellow gravel. As I grab a cleansing cloth, Rachel proceeds to USE HER GLOVED HAND AND SMEAR/CLEAN UP THE SOLIDS AROUND HIS PENIS 😭 

Without delay, I said, “girl use a wipe.” She says, “no you can’t be afraid to get in there” and she smears around the milky dick cheese in earnest, even using the back of her gloved hand to wipe away the milky build up. I repeated, “Girl, USE. A. WIPE.” 

She silently took the wipe from me and helped me clean him. Skin was intact and in good condition. We got him on the purewick. I went on lunch and bought my first pack of cigarettes in months.

My hometown is destroyed. I don’t feel like I’m doing enough. ,"I don’t know how much people outside my area know. I live in Northeast Tennessee. I work in the only level one trauma in a 60 or so mile radius. I am a full time nursing student. 

We were hit hard by Helene. We were absolutely not prepared in our mountain village as these times are actually completely unprecedented. I live on a river just upstream from a dam that kept scheduling releases. 

Friday I was prepared to go to class, but was instead called by my mom freaking out telling me I needed to grab my cats and evacuate because the storm had already destroyed the east side of my town. I never wound up having to leave, but within the day, I had lost cell phone service and WiFi. My neighbors at my apartment and I kept going and watching the river and waiting for any word. The hospital a thousand feet from my complex was evacuated. 

The hospital thirty minutes away was submerged in water. The patients there were transported to my hospital. 58 people were stranded on the roof while they waited for the national guard to rescue them as their new hospital was completely submerged in the flooding. 

While I was completely safe by the grace of god, my old dance studio, one of my childhood homes, my entire downtown were destroyed in the flooding. A house floated down the river behind my apartment. There was a family stranded inside. 

My father and grandmother had no power. My dad is injured. I had no way of checking on them. We still do not have phone service and my wifi has only been restored this morning. We still do not have safe drinking water. Some people don’t have water at all. There are hundreds missing. For days, every 6 hours I was alerted with an emergency message that we were in a life threatening situation. 

The hospital I work at, the town directly beside me, is completely unscathed. I don’t get it. Lots of us at work live in affected communities. When we were under a no travel order, we still went in to work. 

They saw their lives torn away from them, and then continued and still continue to come in to take care of victims of this natural disaster. I have done it. I have cried all weekend 



But what I just don’t understand, and I feel so guilty about it. When they aren’t at work, they’re working disaster relief. They’re volunteering and doing things to help this situation….

But I don’t feel like I can. I feel shell shocked.  I still know of people who are unaccounted for…. And it’s horrific. 


I just don’t feel like I’m doing enough. I work 60 hours a week at the hospital. My career is in the business of saving lives from major trauma… but I can’t handle this.

Working on a specialty, especially a subspecialty, I have definitely lost a lot of knowledge from other specialties. If you don't use it, you lose it for sure. Even working in a subspecialty I will see physicians look up info for other neuro problems on UpToDate and/or say to other providers ""It's been so long that I've treated that, that I don't remember what dose to start at."" That's IMO the biggest negative from working in a specialty.


If you don't have good collaborating physicians, you can definitely become a dumping ground for refills for stable patients. Simple and easy but not always stimulating for your brain. There are some NPs here that have more experience than some of the physicians, but doctor still is valued more. I'm lucky about that and have a great team.

This all came about after a fire, two victims that were similar in age/sex/size, faulty ID by family members, then one died and one didn’t. It was not pretty. Having said all that, I still remember a patient coming in with a EBT card with his name over it and the ED tapped over his name the card and his was John Doe for a week.

Im happy to work with the docs but half of being charge is talking them off a ledge if we are busy.  Anesthesia and I will look up patient see their vitals are stable etc and while there may have been large blood loss prior, they currently aren’t bleeding, and can wait for to follow another case.

RE: Specialty: GI or Rheum?,"I worked in GI for two years and as another comment said it largely depends on the clinic. In my area GI is notoriously difficult to get into bc of surrounding areas clinic and hospital closures and PCPs don’t seem to understand what they can manage or rule out before a referral. I imagine all specialities have this but daily I would have an are-you-kidding-me moment with a referral (19/f epigastric pain x 2 weeks) that could have had an entire PCP workup prior to their visit with me. 

I would ask about mentorship, especially if you are expected to take IBD and liver patients. Make sure there is someone you can bounce ideas off of pretty regularly for your first couple years. A lot of GI is psych and a lot can get really repetitive. I can count on one hand the number of patients that brought in food logs and would track fiber like I recommended. GI just isnt very straight forward and a lot depends on the patient willing to put in the work and have patience which I found to be quite rare. I have seen on here some GI NPs that are doing procedures which is cool and would break up clinic time nicely. I saw 15-16 patients a day, 4 days a week and couldn’t imagine seeing more than that. Some of these patients are *sick* in GI bc they wait and wait or aren’t compliant. It shocked me the number of times a month I would transfer directly to the hospital or call 911.

I know she may seem harsh, but honestly, she's preparing you all for the real world. I wish nursing was more friendly, but it's not. Nurses eat their young ( I don't but that's because I know how it feels, I stg it was like a hazing they put me through my 1st yr.) Doctors will yell, snap, be impatient, roll their eyes and talk down to you until you remind them you're on the same team. Like I said, everyone hated my old instructor, but she was prepping us for real life, and I am so grateful to her for that. Because those doctors, when they round and start rattling off questions, you better be ready with answers. Your assessment had better been done because if you miss anything, you get tossed under the bus.
GO TO YOUR CLINICAL. Don't ruin your career before it starts. Do the work, try to ignore her attitude, and use as fuel to work to prove to her you're gonna be a good nurse. That's what she's looking for. That's why she's blunt but does tell you what to correct so correct it and move on. Don't stage walk-outs during school 1st you're screwing yourselves out of clinical hours & second believe me when I say that your first job will want references from your school at least they used to for new grads.... you don't want drama with that.

Time management, critical thinking, how diseases actually present themselves and the plan of care around them....theres so much. Its normal to be stressed, but not to a physical detriment.

I have learned soooo much since I started, and everything seems to circle back to become important again and again with different patients.

Also, are you already chemo certified? I know some jobs require it right when you start. Just curious, I didn’t get mine until just a few months ago so I’m still new to actually administering it myself

Idk, just food for thought. I think a lot of us would thrive in the job you’re talking about. And it’s definitely the ideal position imo. But make sure you’re genuinely comfortable with onc pts, chemo/blood administration, etc etc.

(At least that’s what she said to them, in private she said if the worse drug seeking patients who come and take up a bed and act rudely to staff for pain meds then she’s going to give them a reason to get and a reason to not come back to our ER to waste our time, in her credit she only did this to most obvious drug seeking patients.) 

RT here also who has done countless ABGs on awake and alert patients and stuck myself to get an ABG a few times. The pain is always overplayed. I’ve had more pain blood draws from employee health when on-boarding because they wipe with the alcohol then go straight in without waiting for it to dry.

RE: ALMOST GAVE WRONG MED!!,"This is a case where I think the preceptor yelling is appropriate. It’s being used to break a potential and very serious habit:

1. They need med dispensers to prevent errors like this from happening. This is not your fault, but this also means you have to double and triple check yourself to form good practice. You may not always have access to systems with a ton of safety features. You need to be able to read the order, pull the associated medication and dose as prescribed.

2. The pt notified you that the med might be wrong. You didn’t double check at that point, you doubled down which thankfully the pt stuck with their insight which prompted you to get your preceptor.

3. As you mentioned Oxycodone as being the order med but you pull a “capsule”, you did not know at the med dispenser, bedside, when the preceptor asked, and still do not seem to know what medication you pulled. Outside of double checking, you should at least keep the packaging for reference until all is good and the med is safely administered.

It’s a harsh lesson, but better to learn it now, perform better practice so that it doesn’t become a habit in the future.",1727890320.0

I went to my ob, labs showed nothing crazy. I thought it was still just wd pregnancy related hormonal stuff. It got to the point where I couldn't stand up more than 30 seconds, was constantly napping, tunnel vision while walking, and INTENSE brain fog. PCP phone nurse over a holiday weekend told me to go to the ER cause based on our conversation she thought there was a neuro problem. I hung up the phone and said I'd go if I still felt bad in a couple days if I still felt bad. Husband said,""no now."" Wound up with a 4 night ICU stay and a couple more in med surg to get my sodium back up from 109, and a new endocrine diagnosis. 

I hated being away from my baby, everyone I talked to just wanted to get me home to him. Two years later though, it feels much better to know how I need to take care of myself. I pumped and sent it home with my husband. I was able to pick up where I left off with my baby, but feeling much better! You are where you need to be to figure things out for yourself and your family!

As a patient though, man I hated having to ring a call bell for the bathroom in ICU. I offered to unhook myself and redo it all (they knew I was a nurse) but they declined. At one point I was on a fluid restriction so I asked for pen and paper and offered to do my own I&O, especially once I actually could use the bathroom on my own.

Now I'm not one to say you need years and years of experience, but at minimum I'd recommend not applying untill you have 2-3 years of nursing experience. 

Economics are tricky. And not one size fits all. It depends on where you are, the cost of the school you are looking at, and the expected salary of where you want to live. For me it was a pretty easy answer - schooling at a well known/respected university was relatively cheap for me and with a move to another nearby state that I was going to make anyways, I almost tripled My staff RN salary. Granted cost of living is higher in my current state, but it was still a significant pay bump. 

You also don't necessarily have to give up the 3 12's. I work in the inpatient setting and we do 3 12's, and I know a few other services that do this as well in my system.

RE: CA NP working at a concierge practice doing out of state telehealth… need advice please! ,"Hi OP.  I started a telemedicine program in our office in 2008 as an RN, and became a NP in 2011.  I've been doing telemedicine on and off since then.  I've been on both the originating and terminating side of things. Here's my insight:  

There are several things that go into telemedicine:

I do telemed out of my clinic now, so I have solid nurses that know how to make the technology work.  The order flow process is a big part of that.  If I give a verbal order, who carries that out and makes sure it happens?  Does the other site have the ability to carry out the orders. Is there even a nurse present on the other side? And God forbid you do telemed to a patients home with no nurse present on either end. That's an exercise in futility for anything serious. The patient is unlikely to carry out any orders....

 First, I would talk to an attorney who understands these issues. Telemedicine, and working across state lines, is very nuanced. Don't expect your employer to know the rules/laws (or trust them). It will probably be some basic low-level administrator, that will tell you it's ""okay"". They will have a lower degree than you, and no obligation to protect your license - so that's on you. You will probably know more than this person, and dealing with them is going to be very frustrating for you. If you get dinged for some technicality, the administrator will not be there to have your back. I promise that. They'll run off with their tail between their legs.

Some states will require you to have a license in each state, and others could be part of an APRN compact license. You will have to research that. Getting a license in different states can be a huge burden.  Not just the paperwork, but rules.  For example, if youre a provider in minnesota, you cannot take more than $50 from a pharma company. That sounds all good, but what that really means is you cannot do any consulting work for them, you cannot speak for them, and you can't even go out for an educational dinner. It's terribly restrictive and will hamper your professional growth.

You should also look into credentialing at institutions across state lines where you would want to do business. For example, do you need credentials at hospital ABC in Kentucky to do a blood draw? What about giving IV antibiotics for a patient in Rochester MN?  So that's credentialing at hospitals and clinics...... What about just calling meds to a pharmacy across state lines?  What if you live in a state where you can prescribe CII drugs, but your patient is vacationing in Florida where a NP can't prescribe hardly anything? These are the nuanced, frustrating problems with telemed.h

There is another good point that was brought up by op:  your insurance. What does it cover? To me, that would be the biggest thing. Don't just assume your employer has you covered.  You will probably want to find a good malpractice, liability, tail coverage, etc....  cover your ass there, and go for 3+ million.  The business likely has the bare minimums if you're lucky.  Cover your ass, that's #1. Don't trust what the administrator tells you for coverage.  Ask to look at the policy yourself.  If you don't understand it, send it to the paragraph below: 

My final point is this, and it's true for any np/pa/md: find an attorney who knows how to deal with healthcare related issues and put them on retainer. It'll cost you a couple thousand dollars but who cares.  That's a small investment in your future. Then you can call and ask questions like this, and don't have to post on Reddit.  A single one hour phone call could answer all of your questions, and if things didn't work out in the long run,  you would then have someone to take care of you in the legal arena. I think this is an underlooked issue. Every professional should have an attorney on retainer. Legal questions will always come up, and God forbid if a serious threat comes up.  If it does, you will have an attorney to protect you.  You'll be happy you did it.",1727847731.0

When patient arrives to the floor. The nurse is responsible for reading, signing and making a copy of the SBAR. ER keeps the copy, floor nurse keeps the original in the patient’s chart. As soon as a patient gets a room assignment, the ER has 10 mins to transport patient.

Concerns: I work on a cardiac step down unit. Because of nurse to nurse phone reports I’ve been able to catch and address serious oversights. 

Examples: a MRSA+ pt being assigned to a double room, critical lab levels not being treated even 12 hours after arrival: hypokalemia, hypothermia, DKA, etc. Results that would warrant patient go to the ICU vs PCU. Unfortunately it’s more often than not. 

Misc info: My boyfriend works in the c suit of a different hospital. He said they are also implementing this new model. I shared my safety concerns as a nurse and he countered with their throughput number concerns.

I’m not the type dodge admission. Because my literal job is to get patients from the ER.  But I am the type to reroute inappropriate admissions to the ICU.

My main concern is- the nurse to nurse phone calls were what allowed me to catch oversights. I worry for patient safety and honestly- my license. It raises eyebrows. 

I’m hoping to hear from nurses who already work with this system in place. I’m also hoping to hear “it’s way better than nurse to nurse phone calls.” Please cause I’m STRESSED. ",1727868585.0

RE: Why do doctors seem so hesitant to consult palliative and start talking about hospice (or is it just me?) ,"I work in palliative care, and absolutely agree.

I think the reasons are very complex.

1) The attitude towards treatment and prognosis have changed. A lot of patients does not realize modern medicine can’t cure all, or that it isn’t always best to “go all in” with medical treatment. Many people get very mad and see it as “the provider has failed and is useless” when they can’t fix your problem, and the ultimate outcome is death. This attitude makes it more difficult.

2) the term “palliative care” has become more fluid the past decade, focusing more on symptom management and less on the fact that death is near. Some might live for a good while even though they require palliative care. Regardless, many people think palliative care means they’re dying tomorrow, and a lot of people get angry when they think of that. And again, blame the provider.

3) Doctors are only human, and stopping/not starting treatment is hard for a lot of them. A doctor I work with (in palliative care) told me once that they never learn to say no in medical school, and the focus isn’t really on ethical thinking. Due to this, they also don’t really get any support from colleagues when making these decisions. They’re in it alone a lot of the time, and trusting yourself enough to stop treatment on a patients behalf takes so much courage. Especially if you’re not that experienced in taking those choices and conversations with patients/families it can be SO hard. 

4) Form my experience, a lot of doctors have a wrong view of “hope”. They believe that placing the palliative care consult will kill the patients hope, and that’s not good. As a nurse in palliative care, I know that false hope is not a good type of hope, but the doctors might not realize that. Also, not referring them to palliative care actually makes them suffer. Personally, I try to help the doctors with this, and sometime offer to have that conversation with the patient, with the doctor there with me. Or I talk to the patient about palliative care before I talk to the doctor, to see how they feel about it.",1727860733.0

RE: The bullying culture towards new grads and students on some units,"It's a really disturbing trend.

When the NUM is away and she's in charge, other staff notice that I am especially anxious.



One day I was very busy and she was trying to pile tasks on me and I said to her assertively ""I'm trying to do an admission, Sarah"". Next minute, she is screaming at me within earshot of patients and staff about my attitude and how I need to fix it. Patients are visibly upset, another nurse is crying and I am fucking furious.

I worked facility based NP and I was “on call” in that the DON had my cell phone number and could call me until 5pm. That wasn’t bad.

Now I work palliative, and it’s a paging service. SNF call can be heavy. 

I’d clarify about reimbursement for 99497. Even follow ups, if you are seeing long term patients you should be having ACP/GOC conversations and should be billing for them in addition to exam.

Anytime I saw a long term patient and was going to write out an entire page of TOs, I’d have a goal of care conversation with the decision maker to make sure that’s what they wanted to do then bill a 99497.

The main thing with SNF is that they can immediately tell that you are not from the SNf world and they can be catty.

SNF charting is pretty straightforward. There are just a lot of regulations. Like no psychotropics. No PRNs for more than 14 days. Initiatives to deprescribe psych meds, PPIs, statins, and dementia medications.

The main thing I see people with no SNF background struggle with is that our patients are expected to get worse and that is just natural disease progression and it’s okay to tell the family that a patient is dying and it’s okay to document that.

They may seem like common sense, but when you're in the thick of it—juggling tasks and responding to crisis after crisis—clear thinking goes out the window. Those seemingly basic but essential things often get lost in the haze and chaos of the day.

It's incredibly unhelpful, and even damaging, to someone trying to build their knowledge, skills, and, most importantly, their confidence, when they bring up a concern to a charge nurse and are told their assignment is easy. On paper, it may look straightforward, but when you factor in a hectic day, trying to improve time management and prioritization, and being a new grad on a floor with extremely ill patients and minimal support, it’s not constructive. In fact, it can be quite detrimental to growth and any chance of building real confidence.

I appreciate you, thank you again! ☺️❤️",1727835807.0

RE: I paged you because I have to. 🙃,"I worked with a trauma surgeon that used to piss me off because he would talk to you and treat you like you were the dumbest sack of meat over the phone and then he dragged his ass in to see the patient and start trying to cut up and joke with you and telling you what a good catch it was.

Two faced fucker pissed me off so bad. 

Best part is, I moved to another state and see a name up on a board and I'm like ""you've got to be fucking kidding me...."" NOPE. IT WAS HIM. 

Somehow we ended up in the same state at the same hospital a second time in a row.",1727777269.0
RE: “Well they always get my blood with a butterfly”,"I remember when I put my first 16G in, I told the patient that there would  be a little stick. When I was done, the patient looked at me and said ""Motherfucker, that wasn't little.""",1727891159.0
RE: Why are nurses the worst patients? Just had a heart attack after being in denial of obvious symptoms all morning. ,We think we know everything. Then as a hospital patient we know what the nurses are doing ...I have been a patient more than I thought I'd ever be and I try to be a better patient and let them do their jobs without my input. I'm so sorry you went through all of that.  It had to be so scary.  💕,1727832375.0
