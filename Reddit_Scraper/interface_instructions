  c. Change the data_files location to wherever you saved your merged_reddit_posts.csv
4. Use this script but update it with the path to your config file to start annotating: 
    potato start "C:\YOUR_FILE_LOCATION\potato\config_folder\config.yaml" -p 8000
5. Type this link into your browser: 
    http://localhost:8000/
6. Create a username and password
7. Start annotating!

The output will be a csv of your answers where you list your output directory. Please email or discord us the results when you are finished annotating.
