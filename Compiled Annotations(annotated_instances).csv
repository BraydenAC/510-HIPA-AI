https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/page/file/1396636/dl?inline

18. The field of nursing has been, and remains, predominantly female.

19. In 2013, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that 90% of registered nurses
were women. See United States Department of Labor, Women’s Bureau, 30 Leading Occupations of Employed Women, 2013 Annual Averages, https://www.dol.gov/wb/stats/ leadoccupations.htm.

20. Nursing involves the performance of duties that require heavy physical exertion, as well as a tremendous amount of physical effort, on a daily basis.

21. Nurses’ daily physical responsibilities include lifting, moving, turning, transferring, supporting and restraining patients, many of whom are heavy, sometimes mentally ill or intoxicated, and even combative. The majority of a nurse’s workday involves walking or standing. Moreover, nurses are vulnerable to workplace violence, in particular, physical assault from patients or patient family members.

22. The physical nature of performing nursing duties substantially increases the risk of back injuries. Nurses suffer a disproportionate number of musculoskeletal disorders during their careers, stemming from the cumulative effect of repeated manual handling of patients.

23. More than half of nurses complain of chronic back pain and 38% of nurses sustain
significant back injuries that require leave from work.

18. The field of nursing has been, and remains, predominantly female.

19. In 2013, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that 90% of registered nurses
were women. See United States Department of Labor, Womenâ€™s Bureau, 30 Leading Occupations of Employed Women, 2013 Annual Averages, https://www.dol.gov/wb/stats/ leadoccupations.htm.

20. Nursing involves the performance of duties that require heavy physical exertion, as well as a tremendous amount of physical effort, on a daily basis.

21. Nursesâ€™ daily physical responsibilities include lifting, moving, turning, transferring, supporting and restraining patients, many of whom are heavy, sometimes mentally ill or intoxicated, and even combative. The majority of a nurseâ€™s workday involves walking or standing. Moreover, nurses are vulnerable to workplace violence, in particular, physical assault from patients or patient family members.

22. The physical nature of performing nursing duties substantially increases the risk of back injuries. Nurses suffer a disproportionate number of musculoskeletal disorders during their careers, stemming from the cumulative effect of repeated manual handling of patients.

23. More than half of nurses complain of chronic back pain and 38% of nurses sustain
significant back injuries that require leave from work.

However, even with a doc not necessarily on site full time, there were still a handful of them a phone call away. The other thing to remember is, youâ€™re working in a low acuity outpatient setting. If anything ever seems off, no one will ever blame you if you call EMS. It rarely happens, but I have had to do it a couple times. So between your SP and EMS being able to respond in minutes, this should at least give you the peace of mind to go about your day and adjust to the new gig. There will always be a learning curve. Think of it as an opportunity to grow as a clinician. Itâ€™s turned out to be great for me and my own medical decision making, personally. 

Also, it would be helpful to know some details about why the other PA quit. People leave jobs ALL the time in healthcare. Chasing sign on bonuses and whatnot. But high turnover at a particular office can also be a huge red flag. Do you know why they left? How long they had been with the practice? 

tl;dr donâ€™t let this turn you off before you even start. You always have the option of walking away, but it seems to me that it is far too early to make any conclusive decisions about this job.
